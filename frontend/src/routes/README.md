# Routes

> See also the online doc [Routing](https://openvaa.org/developers-guide/frontend/routing) (or [locally](/docs/src/routes/developers-guide/frontend/routing/+page.md))

This directory contains the SvelteKit route structure for the OpenVAA frontend application.

All routes support an optional locale parameter: `[[lang=locale]]`

- Voters app routes are in `[[lang=locale]]/(voters)/`
- Candidate app routes are in `[[lang=locale]]/candidate/`
- Protected candidate routes are in `[[lang=locale]]/candidate/(protected)/`

See the Routing documentation for detailed information.
