-- Question RPC functions
--
-- Functions:
-- - get_questions() - return question categories and their questions in one round trip
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- get_questions RPC: returns question categories and questions in a single round trip
--
-- The return is a single jsonb value of the shape { "categories": [...], "questions": [...] }. It is jsonb rather than a table because the two result sets have different shapes, and because a jsonb return adds no column nullability for the generated types to misstate; the adapter validates the payload with zod.
--
-- p_project_id is REQUIRED and carries no DEFAULT, so a caller that omits it gets an undefined_function error rather than every project's questions.
--
-- Filter semantics, on the three OPTIONAL axes and for both tables: NULL or empty means "applies to all", never "applies to none". A row is included when the parameter is NULL, when the row's column is NULL, when the column is an empty array, or when the column contains the parameter. Categories and questions are filtered independently, so a question narrower than its category is excluded on its own terms.
--
-- Note that question_categories.election_rounds and questions.election_rounds are JSONB arrays, unlike the scalar nominations.election_round that get_nominations filters; the two predicates are not interchangeable.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER: the reads run with the caller's permissions, so the question_categories and questions RLS policies gate the caller rather than the function owner.
