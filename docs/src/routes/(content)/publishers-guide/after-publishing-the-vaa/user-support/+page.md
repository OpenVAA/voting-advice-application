# User support

During the time the candidate application is open, you will probably receive a number of requests for support.

As described earlier, it’s best to have a plan for or preferably a dedicated person responding to these requests.

With voters, there’s less need for such support but you’d be well advised to monitor the feedback sent by users to find out if they’re having any issues with the VAA.

The developer you’re working with should also keep an eye on the application logs and performance.
