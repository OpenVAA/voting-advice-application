# How to publish a VAA with OpenVAA?

The whole OpenVAA platform is open source and free to use, so one option is to make a copy, called ‘fork’, of the code and base your VAA on it. For the time being, this will require quite a bit of experience in software development, but you should get a running start from the [Developers’ Guide](/developers-guide/quick-start).

If technical development is not your forte or you don’t know a developer to hire for the work, you can also [contact us](/about/association#contact) and we may be able to help you with your project.

We also partner with the [VoteMatch International](https://www.votematchinternational.org/) network, which offers support for introducing VAAs to new democratic contexts.
