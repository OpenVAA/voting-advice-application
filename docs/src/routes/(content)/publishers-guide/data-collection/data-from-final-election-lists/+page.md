# Data from final election lists

After the election lists have been confirmed, you will need to corroborate that the data received from the candidates and parties is accurate.

In addition, some data will only be available at this time, such as:

- [ ] The election numbers of symbols
- [ ] Electoral alliances between parties in each constituency
- [ ] The party or constituency association nominating each candidate in each constituency

If you haven’t asked parties to provide their data beforehand, you may also add at this point logos, brand colors and standard abbreviations to the parties’ data.
