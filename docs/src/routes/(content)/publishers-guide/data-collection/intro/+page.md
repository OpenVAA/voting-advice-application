# Steps for collecting data

After designing your VAA and preparing the content for the statements and their supporting information, you will need to collect all of the data needed for publication.

The steps for data collection can be divided into:

1. initial data, including everything needed before publishing the possible candidate application
2. candidates’ or parties’ answers, which can be collected manually or using the candidate application
3. additional data for the voter application
4. final elections lists
5. moderation of candidate answers.
