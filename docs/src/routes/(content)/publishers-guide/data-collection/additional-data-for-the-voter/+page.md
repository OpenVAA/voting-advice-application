# Additional data for the voter application

Some of the application data is not needed for the candidate application and can, thus, be provided a bit later. These include:

- [ ] Content for the introduction views in the voter application
- [ ] Additional supporting information for statements, such as video
- [ ] Text content only visible in the voter application
