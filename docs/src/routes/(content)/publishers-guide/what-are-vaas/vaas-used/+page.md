# Which kind of elections are VAAs used in?

VAAs are predominantly used in governmental elections, but they may also be used in organizations’ internal elections.

Because they help voters choose their preferred candidates based on their policy opinions, it can be argued that VAAs are even more useful in such organisations where the electorate is not familiar with the candidates beforehand.

Examples of NGOs using VAAs in their internal elections are the Finnish Lutheran church and OP, a Finnish banking cooperative.
