# What are VAAs and why are they useful?

## What are they

Voting advice applications, also known as VAAs, are online applications that help voters to choose a political entity (a party or a candidate) to vote for (Marschall and Garzia 2014, 1). VAAs are typically employed in the context of elections, however, VAAs can also be used in a non-electoral setting. The history of VAAs dates back to the 1980s, when the central operating principle of the VAA was introduced in non-digital form in the Netherlands (Marschall and Garzia 2014, 2). World’s first VAA was introduced in Finland in 1996 by the Finnish National Broadcasting Company for the European parliament election (Vihtonen 2007). During the last three decades, VAAs have become an integral part of election campaigns in many democracies around the world. These tools attract millions of users at the time of elections, especially in countries such as Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland (see, e.g., Statistics Finland 2023; Hansen and Stubager 2019; van de Pol et al. 2019; BPD 2025).

The basic operating principle of a VAA is to compare users’ preferences on political issues to the positions of those entities that are on the ballot. Issue positions are collected by completing a web-survey that allows comparison of user’s answers to answer profiles of political actors. After algorithmic matching the application produces an output which ranks the political entities (e.g., parties and/or candidates) by the level of agreement with the voter. In the results, VAAs might also display graphs that show the user’s position in policy dimensions in respect to parties. (Marschall and Garzia 2014, 1)

VAAs typically encourage users to vote for their most proximate “match” in terms of issue positions. Nearly all VAAs operate with this principle that Fossen and Anderson (2014) call “the matching VAA”. The matching model perceives democracy through the lens of social choice (i.e., preference aggregation), where citizens are assumed to be politically knowledgeable policy shoppers. In this model, the central challenge that VAAs seek to alleviate is the citizens’ ignorance of political actors’ policy positions (Fossen and Anderson 2014). Other models for VAAs have been theorized (e.g., a deliberative VAA), but they have not been widely employed.

VAAs operate based on relatively strong assumptions that its users have clear preferences on the surveyed issues. In reality, not all VAA users have high political knowledge or belief in their capability to understand politics. Moreover, voters can encounter comprehension problems while filling a VAA (Kamoen and Holleman 2017). Despite these shortcomings, VAAs have been an international success story, as their usage has been associated with positive effects for democracy.

## Why are they useful

The main benefit of VAAs is that they lower the cost of voting (Gemenis and Rosema 2014). VAAs serve as information shortcuts for voters, as they provide easily accessible information to voters on which voters can base their vote choice. VAAs can also be exceptionally helpful in various information settings. In the context of low-salience elections, VAAs can inform the voters what the election is about. This educational role of VAAs should not be overlooked. On the other hand, VAAs are also suitable for information intensive environments, where voters are facing an abundance of political information (e.g., many candidates and multiple salient election themes). In information-intensive settings, VAAs can enable voters to shorten the list of viable electoral options. As long as VAAs reduce information acquisition costs and they provide advice that improve the accuracy of one’s vote (in terms of voting according to one’s own preferences), using VAAs can be seen as ecologically rational (Tromborg & Albertsen 2023).

> “VAAs highlight the role of issues in politics. VAAs also help keep politicians accountable.”

From a normative standpoint, issue voting is only among one of many ways one can vote. However, basing one’s vote on politicians' actual issue stances is still preferable to a situation where voters are guessing what the politicians stand for. Making politicians’ stances on issues public can also improve political accountability, as voters and journalists can compare politicians’ actions to their VAA answers.

## What effects do they have

Research on voting advice applications has found that its use has been linked to higher voter turnout, changes in vote choice and a potential increase in political knowledge (Munzert and Ramirez Ruiz 2021). However, it should be noted that many of the earlier VAA studies have been impacted by methodological issues regarding self-selected survey samples (Pianzola 2014). In recent experimental studies, VAA recommendations have been found to affect their users’ party choices, so that many voters change their party choice if it is not congruent with their preferences (Germann et al. 2023; Tromborg & Albertsen 2023).

## Who uses them

VAA users have been predominantly young people and those who have high education level and high political knowledge (Marschall 2014; Albertsen 2022). However, VAA usage has increased in many countries in the last two decades, so that the group of users has become more heterogeneous. This also poses challenges for VAA designers as different VAA user groups might have different needs for the application. In terms of VAA usage intentions, VAA users have been categorized into three groups: checkers, seekers and doubters (van de Pol et al. 2014). Checkers use VAAs merely to confirm their vote choice, or they use VAAs for entertainment purposes. These users are politically knowledgeable and they are not typically impacted by the VAA’s recommendation. Seekers and doubters use VAAs to decide who to vote for, but they vary by the degree of vote certainty. (van de Pol et al. 2014)
