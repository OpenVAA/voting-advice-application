# Do you want to ask voters to give feedback about the VAA?

The voters can always use the ‘Give feedback’ option in the application menu to give feedback but you can also actively ask for feedback from them.

If enabled, voters will be asked to give a star rating and optional other comments after having reached the results view (with a delay that can be configured, e.g. 60 seconds).
