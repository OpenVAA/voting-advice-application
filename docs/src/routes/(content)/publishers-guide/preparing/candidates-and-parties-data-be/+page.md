# How should candidates’ and parties’ data be collected?

The complexity of collecting data for your VAA will depend greatly on whether it will be based on parties or candidates – and how many of these will there be.

For each, you will need to collect:

- their basic information such as name
- possibly a candidate portrait or party logo
- their answers to the statements with possible accompanying free-form explanations
- which election and which constituency they’re standing in
- for candidates, the party nominating them
- for parties, the possible electoral alliance they belong to (in each constituency)
- their possible election number or symbol

If there is only a small number of parties, you may be able to collect these data manually with online forms or by sending spreadsheets to fill.

In candidate-based settings, this is, however, seldom feasible and you will need to enable the platform’s candidate application so that they can enter their data themselves.

## How should candidates register for the VAA?

For candidate registration, there are two options.

### 1. Email-based registration

This is the simpler choice, but you will need to collect a list of the candidates’ emails. Because the electoral authorities do not usually publish such lists at all or early enough, you will usually need to contact the parties standing in the elections to get these lists.

Once you have the lists, the emails can be added to the VAA after which the candidates will be able to enter their data by signing up with their email. They can also be sent reminders to sign up if they haven’t done so.

### 2. Bank-authentication-based preregistration

In some cases, however, procuring the candidates lists from the parties may be hard or impossible.

With bank-authentication-based preregistration anyone can sign up as a preliminary candidate and enter their data in the application.

Their full name and birth date will be stored, and these can be used to select only officially confirmed candidates to be included in the VAA when it’s published to voters. At the same time, the parties nominating them and any other information from the lists can be automatically added to their data.

The downside of using the bank-authentication method is that it will require a subscription to an authentication provider, which may cost up to a few thousands of euros. It will also require a somewhat more complex setup than the simple method.

## Where can official election lists be found?

In order to corroborate the data candidates give out – such as which party they stand for and in which constituency – it is best to rely on the official electoral lists published by the body organising the elections. And if you’re using bank-authentication-based preregistration, these will be required.

## How long should the application be open for candidates?

We recommend keeping the application open for candidates for at least one or 1.5 months but preferably a bit longer.

It’s usually advisable to also close it for candidates before the VAA is published to voters so that the results they receive do not change (and that you have time to moderate the answers if necessary).

## How will you offer technical support for candidates?

It is very often the case that candidates will require assistance when registering for or using the candidate application.

In our experience up to 10% or even 20% of candidates may contact support, so it’s best to have a clear plan for dealing with such requests.

A spike in such attempts will probably take place right before the deadline for candidates to submit their answers – or within a week _thereafter_ as those who missed the deadline still want to enter their information. (The application can be reopened if you so wish.)

The candidate application also has a Frequently asked questions page onto which answers to common problems can be added.
