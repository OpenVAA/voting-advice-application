# Do you want to offer a survey for voters to fill?

In addition to simple feedback, you can also ask voters to fill in a more comprehensive survey.

If enabled, voters will be shown a request to fill in the survey after having reached the results view as well as in other parts of the app.

You will need to provide an external link for the survey and voters will be pointed to that if they choose to take the survey.
