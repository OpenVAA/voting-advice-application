# Timeline

The time required for publishing a VAA may vary a lot but in our experience the following is a somewhat safe schedule.

| Step                                                                                                                                        | Duration   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Statement formulation and creating supporting content                                                                                       | 2–3 months |
| Collecting other data and brand assets                                                                                                      | 2 weeks    |
| Testing the application before publishing the candidate application                                                                         | 2 weeks    |
| Candidate application open for                                                                                                              | 1.5 months |
| Moderation of candidates’ answers (this period can also serve as an extension for answering for candidates who missed the initial deadline) | 1 week     |
| Application open for voters for                                                                                                             | 1 month    |

Thus, counting back from the election day, it’s best to start the VAA project 6–7 months before that.

If you will not be using the candidate application, the time reserved for that will be used to otherwise collect answers to the statements from the candidates or parties.
