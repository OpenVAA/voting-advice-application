# What data should be collected from voters’ use of the VAA?

No data are collected from voters by default, but if you wish to collect data about how they use the app, you can enable this.

If data collection is enabled, voters will be shown a banner asking for permission for data collection when they start the VAA. Only if they grant this, will their data be collected.

For data collection, you will also need to use an external service to store the data. Currently, the platform has a built-in adapter for doing this with [Umami](https://umami.is/).
