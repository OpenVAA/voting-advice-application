# Which languages will the VAA be published in?

The VAA can be published in any one language or combination thereof.

The language affects all of the application’s content. Candidates or parties can also provide their answers in any of the languages you select for the app.

## Are all the languages available?

The currently available languages can be seen in the [translations folder](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/tree/main/frontend/src/lib/i18n/translations).

If the language you would like to use is not available, it can be added by creating [new translation files](/developers-guide/localization/supported-locales). This process is a bit arduous and is best started using an LLM.
