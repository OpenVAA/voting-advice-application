# Local translations

Local translations are stored in `$lib/i18n/translations` and organized by language and key. The logic by which they're separated into different files is not absolutely rigid, but the following principles should be followed:

1. Create a new file for each Voter App page or [dynamic component](/developers-guide/frontend/components), named `<pageOrComponentName>.json`.
2. Create a new file for each Candidate App page, named `candidateApp.<pageName>.json`.
3. For translations needed by [static components](/developers-guide/frontend/components), create a new subkey in the `components.json` file.

Whenever adding translations, be sure to create them for all supported languages.

### The [`TranslationKey`](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/blob/main/frontend/src/lib/types/generated/translationKey.ts) type

The available translation keys are defined by the [`TranslationKey`](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/blob/main/frontend/src/lib/types/generated/translationKey.ts) type. These can be automatically generated by running `yarn workspace @openvaa/frontend generate:translation-key-type`.

If you need to use a dynamically constructed translation key that is not recognized by the linter, use the [assertTranslationKey](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/blob/main/frontend/src/lib/i18n/utils/assertTranslationKey.ts) utility.

When committing any changes the `pre-commit` hook will check that the type matches the translations.
