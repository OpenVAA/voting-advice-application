# Automatic Documentation Generation

The documentation for the repository, i.e. this very site, is partly automatically generated.

The site, its contents and scripts used in the generation are contained in the [`docs` package](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/tree/main/docs) of the monorepo.

See the README file in the package for more information.
