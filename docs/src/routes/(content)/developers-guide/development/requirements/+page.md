# Requirements

- Yarn 4
- Docker (unless you plan to run the app outside of Docker)
- Node.js. Use the version specified under `engines` in the root [package.json](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/blob/main/package.json). Use of nvm is encouraged for Node version management
- Ports 1337, 5173 and 5432 should be free for the application if using default settings
  - These ports can be changed in the `.env` file if desired.
