# Workflows

The project uses GitHub Actions among other things to verify each commit passes unit tests, is able to build the app successfully and adheres to the [coding conventions used by the project](/developers-guide/contributing/code-style-guide). If a commit fails the verification, please check your changes from the logs and fix changes before submitting a review request.
