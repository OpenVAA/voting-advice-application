# AI agents

Agent information is currently only provided for Claude in [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/blob/main/CLAUDE.md), which can be used as a base for other agents’ instructions.

There are Github workflows for code review, issue solving and generic tasks for Claude. These are triggered by commenting on PRs or issues with `@claude, review`, `@claude, solve` or `@claude [generic prompt]`. The author of the issue or comment must be a repository member with write access.
