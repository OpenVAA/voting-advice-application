# Issues

### Create a new issue

If you detect a problem with the application or have a new request, search first in the list of issues to see whether or
not a similar issue has already been reported by someone else. If the issue doesn't exist, you can open a new one by
following these steps.

1. Add a descriptive title.
2. Add a descriptive description.
3. Assign the issue to the Voting Advice Application project.
4. [Add labels](#issue-labels).

### Search for an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/OpenVAA/voting-advice-application/issues). You can
narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Issue labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with. On the other hand, labels allow us to manage the project and categorize the information in a more meaningful way.

Currently, the labels divide into four categories:

- Category: [CATEGORY] => This category lets us know what category the issue belongs to. Fox example, if the issue contains only security related changes, the label will be `category: security`.
- Status: [STATE of ISSUE] => This category lets us know what state the issue is in right now.
- Type: [TYPE OF ISSUE] => This category lets us know what type of issue this is. For example, if the issue is a bug, the label will be `type: bug`, or if the issue is a new feature, the label will be `type: feature`.
- Scope: [SCOPE] => This category describes the scope of this issue. For example, suppose that the issue involves the voter side of the app. Then the appropriate label would be `scope: voter`.

Do not add more than one label from each category in each issue or pull request.

It is imperative to add labels to the new issues. If you are not sure which labels to add, you can always ask for help from the team.

Additionally, please use Milestones to indicate which release target and scope contribution belongs to (for example: Alpha version, Beta version, Post-launch bug fixing patch, etc.).
