# Customized behaviour

The Strapi backend has been customized in many ways to cater to VAA needs. The current implementation is split between direct edits to Strapi code and some functions implemented in the [OpenVAA Admin Tools plugin](/developers-guide/backend/openvaa-admin-tools-plugin-for-strapi). Most of the customizations should be migrated to the plugin in the future.
