# Style guides

In general, Prettier formats the code in a nice way, but there are other requirements that you must take care of manually.

## Comments

Do not manually break comments into lines of a certain length unless separating paragraphs. This enables developers to use line-wrapping based on their own preference without adding unneccessary lines to the code.

## TypeScript

We follow the conventions of [TypeScript Style Guide](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/) with the following exception:

- [The naming conventions](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#variables-1) for booleans are optional but if possible should be adhered to.

Common errors, which will be flagged, include:

- `Array<Foo>` must be used instead of `Foo[]`
- Type parameters cannot be single letters: `type Foo<TBar> = ...` instead of `type Foo<T>`.

### Function parameters

> This requirement is not flagged by automatic checks.

To avoid bugs, try to always use named parameters to functions and methods, when there is any risk of confusion, i.e., in most cases where the functions expects more than one parameter.

To make things smooth, try to use the same names for parameter across the board, so they can be destructured and passed as is, e.g.

```typescript
const { foo } = getFoo();
const { bar } = getBar();
foobar({ foo, bar }); // Instead of foobar({ foo: foo, bar: bar })
function foobar({ foo, bar }: { foo: string; bar: string }) {
  // Do smth
}
```

#### TS Style

We use https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/ for the most parts. Most issues should be automatically flagged by Github workflows, but keep your especially open for these common issues:

#### File organization

Try to separate pure type files from the functional ones and keep them next to each other, as well as tests. Do not usually collect these into separate folders. E.g.

- `foo.ts`: The file to compile
- `foo.type.ts`: Related types and types only
- `foo.test.ts`: The unit tests

## CSS

See the [styling guide](../frontend/styling.md) for information about using Tailwind classes.

## Svelte components

### File structure

Put each component in its own folder in `$lib/components`. Multiple components that are integrally tied together may be included in the same folder (but see note below on exports). Separe the type definitions in a `.type.ts` file and provide an `index.ts` for easy imports. Thus, the `$lib/components/myComponent` folder would have the files:

- `MyComponent.svelte`: the component itself
- `MyComponent.type.ts`: the type definitions for the component's properties
- `index.ts`: provides shortcuts to imports:
  ```ts
  export {default as MyComponent} from './MyComponent.svelte;
  export * from './MyComponent.type;
  ```

**NB.** All components exported from the `index.ts` file, will be loaded even when only one of them imported in the application, so place multiple components in the same folder tree only when it's absolutely necessary.

### Component properties

Currently, most components use attribute forwarding with [Svelte's `$$restProps` variable](https://svelte.dev/docs/basic-markup#attributes-and-props). This means that any HTML or SVG attributes that the main element of the component accepts can be passed as the components properties â€“ or, in case of a component derived from another Svelte component, the parent components properties. See the examples for details on how this is done. This is most commonly used for passing extra classes to the element.

#### Default values for properties included `$$restProps`

In most cases, default values for properties included in `$$restProps`, such as `aria-hidden` can be just added as attributes in the relevant element or component. The only thing to keep in mind is that they must precede `$$restProps`, otherwise they will override the values in it. For example:

```tsx
<div aria-label="Default label" {...$$restProps}>
  ...
</div>
```

However, if you want to concatenate values with properties in `$$restProps`, such as concatenating a default `class` string with one possibly defined in `$$restProps`, this should be added after `{...$$restProps}`. To make this easier, a `concatClass` helper function is provided in [`$lib/utils/components`](../../frontend/src/lib/utils/components.ts). For example:

```tsx
<div {...concatClass($$restProps, 'default-class')}>...</div>
```

#### Aria attributes and the `class` attribute

Note that you most Aria attributes cannot be exposed with `let export foo` because their names contain dashes, which also applies to the HTML `class` attribute. In order to access these, either use the `$restProps` object or specify them in the properties type the component uses, i.e., the one assigned to `type $$Props` and access them via `$$props`. For example:

```tsx
// Foo.type.ts
export type FooProps = SvelteHTMLElements['p'] & {
  'aria-roledescription'?: string | null;
  class?: string | null;
};

// Foo.svelte: <script>
type $$Props = FooProps;
let ariaDesc: $$Props['aria-roledescription'] = $$props['aria-roledescription'];
let className: $$Props['class'] = $$props['class'];
```

### Documentation

Follow Svelte's [guidelines for component documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs/faq#how-do-i-document-my-components). For an example, see [`IconBase`](../../frontend/src/lib/components/icon/base/IconBase.svelte) component and its associated [type definition](../../frontend/src/lib/components/icon/base/IconBase.type.ts).

Place the Svelte docstring at the top of the file, before the `<script>` block.

Add documentation for pages, layouts and other non-reusable components, detailing their main purpose. Include in their documentation under separate subheadings:

- `Settings` affecting the page
- Route and query `Params` affecting the behaviour

It is not necessary to duplicate the documentation of the individual properties in the doc string of the `.svelte` file, because the properties should have their explanations directly in the interface definition in the `.type.ts` file (using [`/** ... */` JSDoc comments](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html)). The component's possible slots should, however, be included in the doc string.
