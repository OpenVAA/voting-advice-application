### Labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with. On the other hand, labels allow us to manage the project and categorize the information in a more meaningful way.

Currently, the labels divide into four categories:

- Category: [CATEGORY] => This category lets us know what category the issue belongs to. Fox example, if the issue contains only security related changes, the label will be `category: security`.
- Status: [STATE] => This category lets us know what state the issue is in right now.
- Type: [TYPE OF ISSUE] => This category lets us know what type of issue this is. For example, if the issue is a bug, the label will be `type: bug`, or if the issue is a new feature, the label will be `type: feature`.
- Scope: [SCOPE] => This category describes the scope of this issue. For example, suppose that the issue involves the voter side of the app. Then the appropriate label would be `scope: voter`.

Do not add more than one label from each category in each issue or pull request.

It is imperative to add labels to the new issues. If you are not sure which labels to add, you can always ask for help from the team.

Additionally, please use Milestones to indicate which release target and scope contribution belongs to (for example: Alpha version, Beta version, Post-launch bug fixing patch, etc.).
