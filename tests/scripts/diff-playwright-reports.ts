/**
 * Compare two Playwright JSON reports (baseline vs post-swap) per D-59-04.
 *
 * Parity rules (from 59-CONTEXT.md D-59-04, refined by baseline/summary.md):
 *
 *   - Every test in the baseline PASS_LOCKED_TESTS set (41 tests) MUST pass
 *     post-swap. A previously-passing test failing or cascading is a BLOCKER.
 *   - Every test in CASCADE_TESTS (25 tests) may remain non-passing or become
 *     passing. Cascade -> pass is acceptable. Cascade -> cascade is acceptable.
 *     Cascade -> data-race-pool (within DATA_RACE_TESTS) is acceptable.
 *     Cascade -> a NEW data-race-like failure OUTSIDE the pool is a BLOCKER.
 *   - Tests in DATA_RACE_TESTS (10 tests) may flake differently post-swap —
 *     they live in the flake pool. Pool membership change within the pool is
 *     acceptable.
 *   - The data-race pool does NOT grow. No test in PASS_LOCKED_TESTS or
 *     CASCADE_TESTS may enter the pool, and no previously-unknown test may
 *     appear failing.
 *   - SOURCE_SKIP_TESTS (13 tests with `test.skip()` in source) are not part
 *     of the parity contract — listed for reconciliation only.
 *
 * "Did not run" / timedOut is counted as a failure per D-59-04 + stored
 * memory feedback_e2e_did_not_run.md (load-bearing for the delta-rule
 * interpretation).
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — parity satisfied; prints `PARITY GATE: PASS`.
 *   1 — regression detected; prints `PARITY GATE: FAIL` with diff table.
 *   2 — usage error or IO failure.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   tsx diff-playwright-reports.ts <baseline.json> <post-swap.json>
 *
 * Self-identity smoke test (comparing a report to itself yields PARITY PASS):
 *   tsx diff-playwright-reports.ts baseline/playwright-report.json \
 *                                  baseline/playwright-report.json

// PHASE 73 REGEN (2026-05-11, Phase 73 D-08 + D-09 + RESEARCH Pitfall 5).
// Source: .planning/phases/73-determinism-baseline/post-fix/run-3-report.json
// Regen script: .planning/phases/73-determinism-baseline/post-fix/regen-constants.mjs
//
// The 14 imgproxy-tied tests (1 direct + 13 cascades; 15 IDs because re-auth.setup.ts
// runs in two projects) classify exclusively into DATA_RACE_TESTS per D-09 — RESEARCH
// Pitfall 5 documents the rationale (intermittent infrastructure flake, not
// deterministic). The pool MUST NOT grow.
//
// PRIOR EMBEDS (Phase 64 baseline, 2026-04-27 SHA 2832c4410) replaced by this regen:
// 66 PASS_LOCKED + 15 DATA_RACE + 21 CASCADE = 102 tests. The Phase 73 anchor
// reflects the canonical v2.9 cold-start state: imgproxy container down (PROJECT.md
// "Known infrastructure issue") + the auth.setup retry-with-reload cycle that surfaces
// as backend-cold cascade to many voter/candidate tests. This produces the wider
// CASCADE pool (55 tests) vs P64's 21 — most tests are cascade-skipped downstream of
// the auth-setup race that's bundled with the imgproxy infrastructure debt. The
// 4 PASS_LOCKED tests (data-setup, 2× data-teardown projects, data-teardown-variants)
// are the only tests that run without an auth-cookie/candidate-mutation upstream.
//
// Once the imgproxy infrastructure issue resolves (future v2.10+ phase), a re-capture
// will collapse most of the CASCADE pool back into PASS_LOCKED; the binding contract
// here is the post-Phase-73 baseline. Phase 73's regenerated DATA_RACE_TESTS is
// IDENTICAL to P64's (the 14 imgproxy-tied + dual-project re-auth = 15) — D-09 is
// honored without growing the pool.
//
// Format: '<projectName> :: <specFile> > <specTitle>' — matches `flattenReport`
// output below. Re-embed by running the regen script after a new canonical capture.
