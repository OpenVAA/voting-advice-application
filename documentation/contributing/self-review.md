### Self-review

You should always review your own PR first before assigning a reviewer to it. Below you can find a checklist of things
you should check before submitting your PR.

- [ ] Confirm that the changes solve the issue you are trying to solve partially or fully.
- [ ] Verify that your unit tests are running successfully.
- [ ] Review your changes by yourself before assigning a reviewer to the pull request. This will help you spot issues
      like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide or content that is added by mistake.
- [ ] Adhere to the [style guides](style-guides.md). Most style guidelines are enforced by prettier, but you must 
  double-check that your changes follow the style guide used in this project.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.
