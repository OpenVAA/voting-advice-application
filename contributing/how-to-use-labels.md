### Labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with. On the other hand, labels allow us to manage the project and
categorize the information in a more meaningful way.

Currently, the labels are divided into three categories:

- Persona: [WHO] => This category lets us know who is the persona that will benefit from solving the respective issue.
- Task: [INVOLVES] => This category lets us know what type of task the issue is about. For example, suppose the issue is 
  about writing some code. In that case, the label will be `task: development`, or if the issue is about writing some 
  documentation, the label will be `task: documentation`.
- Type: [TYPE OF ISSUE] => This category lets us know what type of issue this is. For example, if the issue is a bug, the
  label will be `type: bug`, or if the issue is a new feature, the label will be `type: feature`.

It is imperative to add labels to the new issues. If you are not sure which labels to add, you can always ask for help 
from the team.
