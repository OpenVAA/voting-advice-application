# Voting Advice Application
A platform for creating voting advice applications. This repository is a monorepo containing the frontend and backend.

- See [the frontend Readme](frontend/README.md) for instructions on running the frontend individually.
- See [the backend Readme](/backend/vaa-strapi/README.md) for instructions on running the backend individually.
