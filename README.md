# OpenVAA Voting Advice Application

A software framework for creating [Voting Advice Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_advice_application) (VAA), also known as Election Compasses. In short, VAAs are applications that help voters find candidates or parties in elections based on how much they agree about political or value statements. They’re currently most popular in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and the German-speaking part of Europe.

This repository is a monorepo containing the frontend and backend, as well as other modules. In addition to the voters’ frontend, there is a similar UI for candidates that they can use to input their answers.

The project is coordinated by the Finnish non-profit association [OpenVAA](https://openvaa.org/en) and funded by [Sitra](https://www.sitra.fi/en/) – the Finnish innovation fund.

The project is currently in an alpha phase with the onus being on refactoring the existing code base for greater robustness and a better developer experience, as well as implementing some missing features.

We released two pilot VAAs for the 2024 EU Elections, which you can try out to see the software in action.

## 🎢 Roadmap

**2024 Q3** — Refactor the current codebase, especially:

- Abstract the frontend–backend connection into a `dataProvider` API enabling arbitrary backend implementations
- Implement a `@openvaa/data` data model for VAA and election data
- Convert `@openvaa/data`, `@openvaa/matching` and `@openvaa/filters` pseudo-modules into independent modules. These handle together the application logic and are independent of the frontend and backend implementations
- Implement the most crucial missing features, such as constituency selection and support for multiple simultaneous elections
- Expand unit and end-to-end test coverage

**2024 Q4** — Release the first full VAA to the public, including the interface for the candidates to input their answers (Tampere youth council elections)

- Create a project site with documentation, which is currently spread between the [`/docs`](./docs/) folder and in-code `TSDoc` comments
- Create a research-backed methodological guide to supplement the technical documentation
- Build application manager UI
- Enable plugins or easier customisation of pages and main components

**2025 Q2** — Release VAAs in the Finnish county elections

**2025 Q3** — First production release

## 🪢 Collaborate

In addition to developers and designers willing to contribute to the codebase (see below), we’re also looking for researchers to collaborate with and organisations willing to publish their own VAAs. Reach us at info@openvaa.org if you’re interested.

## 🍭 Contributing

We’re very happy to accept any help in coding, design, testing, translating and so on. If you want to help, drop a line at info@openvaa.org.

See [the contribution guide](docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further info about contributing to the project.

## Getting started

You can run the whole application in a single Docker image, or run the frontend or backend separately depending on your preferences. Using the Docker image is recommended and the quickest way to set up the application.

- See [the Docker setup guide](docs/docker-setup-guide.md) for running the whole application.
- See [the frontend Readme](frontend/README.md) for instructions on running the frontend individually.
- See [the backend Readme](/backend/vaa-strapi/README.md) for instructions on running the backend individually.

The project is a monorepo and it consists of several yarn workspaces (each is a separate NPM module):

- Abstract logic
  - [`@openvaa/core`](./packages/core/)
  - [`@openvaa/data`](./packages/data/)
  - [`@openvaa/matching`](./packages/matching/)
  - [`@openvaa/filters`](./packages/filters/)
- Application
  - [`@openvaa/app-shared`](./packages/app-shared/)
  - [`@openvaa/strapi`](./backend/vaa-strapi/)
  - [`@openvaa/frontend`](./frontend/)

All workspaces share a single `yarn.lock` file located at the project root but contain their own `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` files.

The workspaces can be addressed by yarn from any directory as follows:

```bash
yarn workspace [module-name] [script-name].
```

f.e. the shared module can be build by running:

```bash
yarn workspace @openvaa/app-shared build
```

### Module resolution

#### IDE

In order to resolve cross `import`s between the monorepo modules Visual Code Studio uses TypeScript references, which are defined in the `tsconfig.json` files of the corresponding modules.

In other words, you DO NOT have to build the **dependee** modules in order for the IDE to resolve their `import`s within a **dependent** module or to pick up changes you make in the **dependee’s** `.ts` sources.

#### NPM/Node

When you use Yarn and during runtime NPM/Node module resolution mechanism is used instead. It relies on various pointers defined in `package.json` files of the corresponding modules (e.g. `main`, `module` or `exports`). These pointers usually refer to `build`/`dist` directory containing already transpiled TS sources of a given module (`.js` files). This directory subsequently gets symlinked by `yarn install` in a `node_modules` directory of a **dependent** module.

In other words, you DO have to build the **dependee** modules prior to running a **dependent** module or using Yarn on it, so that NPM/Node can find the transpiled `.js` sources and pick up changes you make in the original `.ts` code (see also on hot module reloading support or a lack of such [here](./docs/docker-setup-guide.md#hot-reloading)).

## E2E tests

The project uses Playwright for E2E testing. The tests rely on generated data which the local PosgresDB is being seeded with.

To run the E2E tests start all the services locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

... and then:

```bash
yarn playwright install
yarn test
```

If you encounter any unexpected issues with the E2E tests, make sure to bring down the Docker stack properly to reseed the DB with the original mock data (more on mock data [here](./backend/vaa-strapi/README.md#mock-data)).

To bring down the Docker stack properly (delete all containers, images and named volumes which include backend DB volume with potentially seeded mock data) run:

```bash
yarn dev:down
```

## Maintaining dependencies

The project uses [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to maintain security updates for its dependencies. Dependabot will create automated pull requests monthly to fix potential known security issues in application dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) for solutions to some common issues.

You can also find further documentation in the [docs](docs/) folder.
