The sub-directory operationTrees stores visualization data automatically collected and saved during the condensation process.

Run npm run dev:vis to launch the UI to see how the output arguments are formed! Even if you haven't run a single condensation, you can use previously created data (from a real run) to see an example of how to track the processing steps in your own condensation runs. This example data is in Finnish, on the subject "Should the voting age be lowered to 16 in local elections?".
