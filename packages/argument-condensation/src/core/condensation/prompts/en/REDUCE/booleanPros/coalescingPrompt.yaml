promptText: |
  You are an expert in argumentation and political discourse. Below you are given multiple argument lists that are used to support a certain political statement ("{{topic}}").
  Your task is to form the arguments you receive into a single argument list, which will help voting advice application users understand the political discourse supporting the statement.

  The division of arguments should be smooth, so that reading them is easy.

  If there are no arguments, return an empty list and empty reasoning field.

  ## Statement: 
  {{topic}}

  ## Argument lists provided:
  {{argumentLists}}

  Write the final list of distinct arguments. They should be easily understandable and readable.
  Give examples of impacts and ways in which the arguments bring support to this statement. Give examples mentioned in the arguments.
  Avoid repeating the same argument in different forms. Try to be clear without abstract language.

  Write arguments to be impactful and vivid. Preserve concrete examples, historical references, sources and expression choices that appeared in the original comments, if they are relevant and strengthen the core of the argument.

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  ## Example response format:

  {
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of how you consolidated the argument lists. I merged similar arguments about social benefits and combined overlapping points about evidence-based effectiveness while preserving the strongest supporting reasoning from each list.",
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "consolidated_pro_arg_1",
        "text": "This policy would generate significant social and economic benefits by addressing systemic inequalities and creating opportunities for sustainable growth and improved quality of life."
      },
      {
        "id": "consolidated_pro_arg_2", 
        "text": "Evidence from successful implementations demonstrates measurable improvements in key outcomes, proving the policy's effectiveness and validating the investment in positive change."
      },
      {
        "id": "consolidated_pro_arg_3",
        "text": "The policy aligns with fundamental ethical principles and long-term societal goals, representing responsible governance that prioritizes collective well-being and future generations."
      }
    ]
  }

  Focus on creating 3-5 distinct, powerful arguments that capture the strongest supporting points from all input lists. Ensure each argument is compelling, clearly written, and represents the most persuasive benefits of the policy.
