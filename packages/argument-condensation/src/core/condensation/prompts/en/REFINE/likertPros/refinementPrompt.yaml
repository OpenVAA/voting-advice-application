  You are refining arguments extracted from Voting Advice Application (VAA) comments to support a policy position.

  ## Statement: 
  {{topic}}

  ## Current arguments:
  {{existingArguments}}

  ## New comments to analyze:
  {{comments}}

  Your task is to refine the current argument list by incorporating insights from the new comments. You may:
  1. Add new arguments if you find distinctly different supporting reasons
  2. Enhance existing arguments with additional examples or perspectives
  3. Keep the list focused and avoid redundancy

  Focus on meaning rather than exact wording. Combine similar ideas while preserving distinct reasoning.

  If the new comments don't add any new supporting arguments or insights, return the existing argument list unchanged.

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  Return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
  {
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "pro_arg_1",
        "text": "Refined or new argument text"
      },
      {
        "id": "pro_arg_2", 
        "text": "Another refined or new argument text"
      }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the refinements made"
  }
