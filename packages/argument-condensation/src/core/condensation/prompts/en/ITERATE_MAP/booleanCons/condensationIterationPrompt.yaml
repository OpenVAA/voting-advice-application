promptText: |
  You are refining arguments that oppose a policy position ("{{topic}}") based on additional feedback from comments.

  Below are the current arguments extracted from a batch of comments, followed by the original comments for context.
  Your task is to improve these arguments by making them more accurate, compelling, and representative of the opposition expressed in the comments.

  ## Statement:
  {{topic}}

  ## Current arguments:
  {{arguments}}

  ## Original comments for context:
  {{comments}}

  Review the arguments and improve them by:
  1. Making them more precise and compelling
  2. Ensuring they accurately reflect the opposition in the comments
  3. Adding nuance or important details that were missed
  4. Combining or separating arguments if needed for better clarity

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  ## Response format:

  {
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of how you refined the arguments. I improved the clarity of economic concerns, strengthened the individual freedom argument, and added more specific details about implementation challenges based on the comments.",
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "refined_con_arg_1",
        "text": "Refined version of the first opposing argument with improved clarity and compelling details."
      },
      {
        "id": "refined_con_arg_2", 
        "text": "Refined version of the second opposing argument with better nuance and accuracy."
      },
      {
        "id": "refined_con_arg_3",
        "text": "Refined version of the third opposing argument with additional important details."
      }
    ]
  }

  Focus on creating strong, well-reasoned opposition arguments that accurately capture the concerns expressed in the comments.
