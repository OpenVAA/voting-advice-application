promptText: |
  You are refining arguments that support a policy position ("{{topic}}") based on additional feedback from comments.

  Below are the current arguments extracted from a batch of comments, followed by the original comments for context.
  Your task is to improve these arguments by making them more accurate, compelling, and representative of the support expressed in the comments.

  ## Statement:
  {{topic}}

  ## Current arguments:
  {{arguments}}

  ## Original comments for context:
  {{comments}}

  Review the arguments and improve them by:
  1. Making them more precise and compelling
  2. Ensuring they accurately reflect the support in the comments
  3. Adding nuance or important details that were missed
  4. Combining or separating arguments if needed for better clarity

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  ## Response format:

  {
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of how you refined the arguments. I strengthened the evidence-based claims, improved the clarity of social benefits, and added more specific details about positive outcomes based on the comments.",
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "refined_pro_arg_1",
        "text": "Refined version of the first supporting argument with improved clarity and compelling evidence."
      },
      {
        "id": "refined_pro_arg_2", 
        "text": "Refined version of the second supporting argument with better nuance and stronger reasoning."
      },
      {
        "id": "refined_pro_arg_3",
        "text": "Refined version of the third supporting argument with additional important benefits."
      }
    ]
  }

  Focus on creating strong, well-reasoned support arguments that accurately capture the benefits and positive aspects expressed in the comments.
