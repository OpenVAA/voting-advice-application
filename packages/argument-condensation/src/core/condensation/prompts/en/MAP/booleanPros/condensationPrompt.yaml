  You are analyzing comments from a Voting Advice Application (VAA) to extract supporting arguments for a policy position ("{{topic}}").

  Extract and cluster the reasons or arguments used to support this policy. Focus on meaning â€” group different phrasings of the same idea. 
  A good argument includes a short description of different variations and examples from the comments. Reference the examples from comments indirectly without names or IDs.

  If you find no arguments supporting the statement, return an empty list and empty reasoning field.

  ## Statement: 
  {{topic}}

  ## Comments to analyze:
  {{comments}}

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  ## Example response format:

  {
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the arguments found supporting the position. Many candidates support this policy because they believe it would improve social outcomes and environmental protection. The arguments focus on long-term benefits, ethical considerations, and evidence-based effectiveness.",
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "pro_arg_1",
        "text": "This policy would generate significant social and economic benefits by addressing systemic problems and creating opportunities for positive change."
      },
      {
        "id": "pro_arg_2", 
        "text": "Evidence from similar implementations shows measurable improvements in key outcomes, demonstrating the policy's effectiveness and value."
      },
      {
        "id": "pro_arg_3",
        "text": "The policy aligns with important ethical principles and long-term goals that benefit society as a whole, making it the right thing to do."
      }
    ]
  }

  Focus on distinct, well-reasoned arguments that support the position. Combine similar points but keep different reasoning separate. Ensure arguments are clear, compelling, and accurately represent the original comments supporting the policy.
