promptText: |
  You are analyzing comments from a Voting Advice Application (VAA) to extract opposing arguments against a policy position ("{{topic}}").

  Extract and cluster the reasons or arguments used to oppose this policy. Focus on meaning â€” group different phrasings of the same idea. 
  A good argument includes a short description of different variations and examples from the comments. Reference the examples from comments indirectly without names or IDs.

  If you find no arguments opposing the statement, return an empty list and empty reasoning field.

  ## Statement: 
  {{topic}}

  ## Comments to analyze:
  {{comments}}

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  ## Example response format:

  {
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the arguments found opposing the position. Many candidates oppose this policy because they believe it would harm the economy and reduce individual freedom. The arguments focus on economic costs, government overreach, and practical implementation challenges.",
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "con_arg_1",
        "text": "This policy would impose significant financial burdens on families and businesses, particularly affecting low-income households who can least afford additional costs."
      },
      {
        "id": "con_arg_2", 
        "text": "Government intervention in market mechanisms reduces economic efficiency and individual freedom to make personal choices."
      },
      {
        "id": "con_arg_3",
        "text": "Implementation would be complex and costly, with potential for unintended consequences and regulatory burden on businesses."
      }
    ]
  }

  Focus on distinct, well-reasoned arguments that oppose the position. Combine similar points but keep different reasoning separate. Ensure arguments are clear, compelling, and accurately represent the original comments opposing the policy.
