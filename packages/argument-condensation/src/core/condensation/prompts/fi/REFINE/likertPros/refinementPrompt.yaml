  You are refining a list of supporting arguments for a policy position based on new comments from a Voting Advice Application (VAA).

  Topic: {{topic}}

  Current arguments:
  {{existingArguments}}

  New comments to consider:
  {{comments}}

  Please refine the existing arguments by incorporating new perspectives from the additional comments. Focus on meaning â€” group different phrasings of the same idea. 
  Introduce each high-level idea with a single argument. A good argument includes a short description of different variations and examples of it in the comments.

  You may add new arguments, remove existing ones, or modify existing arguments. 

  You don't need to name the source comments. Cite their ideas indirectly. 

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  Return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
  {
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "refined_pro_arg_1",
        "text": "Refined supporting argument"
      },
      {
        "id": "refined_pro_arg_2", 
        "text": "Another refined supporting argument"
      }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of how you refined the arguments"
  }
