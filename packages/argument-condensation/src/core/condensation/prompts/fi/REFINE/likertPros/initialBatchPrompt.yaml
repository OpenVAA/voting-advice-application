  You are analyzing comments from a Voting Advice Application (VAA) to extract supporting arguments for a policy position.

  Topic: {{topic}}

  Comments to analyze:
  {{comments}}

  Please extract and cluster the most common reasons or arguments used in support of this stance. Focus on meaning â€” group different phrasings of the same idea. 
  Introduce each high-level idea with a single argument. A good argument includes a short description of different variations and examples of it in the comments.

  You don't need to name the source comments. Cite their ideas indirectly. 

  IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a JSON object. Do not add any text outside the JSON. Do not write explanations or comments after the JSON. Your response must start with { and end with }.

  Return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
  {
    "arguments": [
      {
        "id": "pro_arg_1",
        "text": "First supporting argument"
      },
      {
        "id": "pro_arg_2", 
        "text": "Second supporting argument"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of how you extracted these arguments"
  }
