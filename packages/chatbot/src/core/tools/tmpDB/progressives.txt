Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D)
Orientation and Ideology

The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) is the center-left, social-democratic group in the European Parliament. It brings together socialist, social-democratic, and labour parties from across the EU (notably Germany’s SPD, Spain’s PSOE, Italy’s PD, etc.). Ideologically, S&D is left-of-center, championing greater social justice, workers’ rights, and a stronger social safety net in Europe

. The group stands for progressive values: it emphasizes reducing inequality, protecting labor and social rights, promoting gender equality, and addressing climate change with a just transition. Pro-European in outlook, the Socialists favor deeper EU integration in areas like social policy, while insisting the EU must be democratic and fair. They advocate a social market economy – supporting capitalism tempered by robust welfare systems, regulation of excesses, and solidarity mechanisms. In issues like taxation, the S&D pushes for cracking down on tax fraud and corporate tax avoidance to fund public services
theparliamentmagazine.eu
. Culturally, they are generally liberal (supportive of minority rights, secularism, etc.), positioning themselves as the progressive alternative to the conservative EPP. In summary, the S&D’s orientation is center-left, pro-EU, and socially progressive, often summarized by the trio of values: social, democratic, sustainable (which indeed was the subtitle of their 2024 manifesto)

2024 Key Policy Positions and Platform

The Party of European Socialists (PES), which underpins the S&D Group, ran on a manifesto titled “The Europe We Want – Social, Democratic, Sustainable.” In the 2024 campaign, social policy and equality were at the forefront of S&D’s platform
theparliamentmagazine.eu
. Key pledges included: ensuring decent jobs and fair wages (EU-wide adequate minimum wages and stronger collective bargaining)
d1xp398qalq39s.cloudfront.net
, investing in affordable housing programs, fighting poverty and social exclusion, and enhancing public services. The S&D promised to fight unemployment (especially youth unemployment) and to make society fairer through redistribution and social protection

. They strongly supported implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights – e.g. rights to fair working conditions, social security, and inclusive education

. Another signature issue was tax justice: the S&D calls for cracking down on tax evasion and taxing the wealthy and multinationals more fairly to fund the welfare state

.

On climate and environment, the Socialists are committed to ambitious climate action but stress the need for a “just transition.” Their manifesto emphasized making the green transition socially fair – providing “renewable and affordable energy for all”, investing in green jobs, and ensuring that workers and vulnerable groups are not left behind
theparliamentmagazine.eu
. S&D parties generally backed the Green Deal measures and proposed strengthening them with social safeguards (for example, the idea of a Climate Social Fund to compensate low-income households, support for small farmers, etc.). They also advocate stronger environmental protections (many S&D parties support stricter rules on pesticides, biodiversity, and cutting emissions, aligning with Greens on several points)

.

Equality and civil rights featured prominently too. The S&D group campaigns to close the gender pay gap and achieve gender equality in the workplace
theparliamentmagazine.eu
. They support inclusive policies for minorities and migrant integration – notably, the S&D stands for treating migration humanely, with fair asylum procedures and sharing responsibility across countries, as opposed to the right-wing approach of fortress-like externalization. (The PES manifesto explicitly “stands against any form of EU border externalisation”, rejecting ideas like offshore asylum processing

.) Instead, the Socialists emphasize solidarity in migration policy, integration of refugees, and making labor markets more open to legal migrants

.

In the realm of economics, besides social welfare, the S&D advocates reforming EU fiscal rules to allow more public investment and flexibility for social spending. They often call for EU-level initiatives to invest in public goods – for instance, a European Green Deal investment plan, or EU funding for housing and healthcare improvements. The S&D also favors strengthening EU-wide rights (like a directive on minimum wages, or protections for gig economy workers). Another notable stance in 2024 was on defense and foreign policy: unlike some past perceptions of the left, today’s S&D also supports a stronger European defense cooperation and standing with Ukraine. The S&D manifesto backed deepening Europe’s defense capabilities (in coordination with NATO) and supported EU enlargement (welcoming new members such as Ukraine in the future)
theparliamentmagazine.eu
. This shows a broad pro-EU internationalist outlook: championing democracy and human rights abroad, and proposing that the EU expand partnerships for development and peace. In sum, the S&D’s 2024 platform can be summed up as social justice at home, sustainability for the planet, and solidarity in Europe and beyond

Historical Context and Evolution

The Socialists & Democrats have a long history in EU politics, being one of the two traditional powerhouse factions in the Parliament. In the early decades of the European Parliament (1980s–1990s), the Socialist Group at times rivaled or even exceeded the EPP in size. The S&D (previously known as the Party of European Socialists, PES, or the Socialist group) has included historic parties like Germany’s SPD, Britain’s Labour (until Brexit), France’s Socialist Party (once significant, though now much diminished), and others. They were behind landmark social and economic initiatives in the EU: for example, Jacques Delors, the European Commission President in the 1980s (a French Socialist), introduced the concept of a “Social Europe” alongside building the single market. Over time, S&D influence led to EU directives on workers’ rights, gender equality, consumer protections, and regional development funds aimed at cohesion

.

However, in the 21st century, social-democratic parties across Europe faced electoral declines in many countries. This was reflected in the European Parliament: the S&D group’s share of seats has gradually fallen from the high points in the 1990s. In 2019, the S&D lost its longstanding second-place position in some countries (for instance, it was overtaken by new parties in France, Italy’s PD suffered losses, etc.), but remained the second-largest group in Parliament

. The 2019–2024 term was challenging for the S&D: they were hit by the Qatargate corruption scandal in late 2022 (involving some Socialist MEPs accused of taking cash for influence), which damaged the group’s image

. Additionally, some member parties shifted ideologically or left – e.g. the Hungarian MSZP virtually collapsed, the Romanian PSD was suspended for a time, and most dramatically, in 2024 the group expelled Slovakia’s SMER (the party of Robert Fico) due to its nationalist, pro-Russian turn

. Despite these hurdles, the S&D maintained a pro-EU, progressive stance and often partnered with the EPP and liberals to pass legislation (like the Green Deal, social funding, and Ukraine aid).

The group’s evolution has also been marked by efforts to renew itself and appeal to younger voters. In the 2010s, many youth and urban voters drifted to Green or leftist parties, so the Socialists have tried to integrate more environmental and digital-age issues into their agenda (hence the strong environmental and inclusion plank in 2024). They also advocate democratic reforms such as transnational election lists and defending the rule of law in EU countries. In summary, historically the S&D has been the pillar of center-left pro-European politics – shaping EU social and regional policies – and continues to adapt to modern challenges by emphasizing equality and sustainability.

Election Performance in 2024

The 2024 election was a mixed bag for the Socialists. The S&D group won 136 seats, making it once again the second-largest group in Parliament, but this total was 12 seats fewer than in the previous term
en.wikipedia.org
. Its share of the EU-wide vote was about 15.6%
en.wikipedia.org
. The S&D thus continued a gentle downward trend, reflecting struggles of social-democratic parties in parts of Europe. That said, the group retained significant strength in several major countries. Notably, Spain and Italy emerged as the largest national contingents for S&D

. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) performed robustly – Spain contributed a large bloc of S&D MEPs, underpinning the group’s overall second-place finish

. In Italy, the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) held its ground and provided the other major chunk of S&D MEPs

. These two countries were a backbone: indeed, Reuters noted that S&D’s “largest bloc of MEPs [came] from Italy and Spain”

.

Elsewhere, the results were more disappointing for the Socialists. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s SPD suffered a “bad result”, coming in third nationally – the SPD’s vote share dropped, yielding a smaller delegation of S&D MEPs from Germany
reuters.com
. In France, the once-formidable Socialist Party barely registered (French left-wing votes mostly went to the Greens/EFA or the radical Left group via Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s list). The Nordic countries saw mixed outcomes: Sweden’s Social Democrats did fairly well, but others like Denmark’s Social Democrats lost some support. In Eastern Europe, social-democratic parties have waned in influence, with a few exceptions. For instance, Romania’s PSD did return a sizable number of MEPs, and Portugal’s Socialist Party won its election handily. Meanwhile, the S&D lost members from Slovakia (as mentioned, SMER was not readmitted due to Fico’s controversial stances)
en.wikipedia.org
, and in Poland the left-leaning parties ran separately (the Democratic Left Alliance had merged into a new Left, which is actually in the Left GUE/NGL group, while the liberal-centrist PO is EPP).

Regionally, the S&D tended to do best in Southern Europe (Spain, Portugal, Malta all had Socialists in first place) and some parts of Western Europe (e.g. the Socialists topped the poll in the Netherlands as part of a left alliance with Greens). They struggled in Central Europe, where voters either went with conservative/nationalist parties or liberals. Despite losing seats overall, the S&D will likely remain a key player in the Parliament’s coalition-building. The center-left, center-right and liberals together still hold a majority, and S&D is expected to continue partnering in a pro-EU alliance (indeed, “the centre-right, socialists and Renew appear on course for a renewed majority” albeit reduced

). In summary, the 2024 performance saw S&D hold the #2 spot with 136 MEPs, thanks to strong showings in Spain and Italy, even as it faced losses in Germany and elsewhere

Voter Base Demographics

Socialist and social-democratic parties traditionally draw support from working-class, lower-income, and socially progressive segments of the population. In 2024, the S&D’s voter base remained rooted in those who prioritize social equality and public welfare. Demographically, this includes many blue-collar workers and trade union members, particularly in countries where unions are strong (for example, industrial workers in Spain’s manufacturing centers, public sector workers in France and the Nordics, etc.). Many urban voters in big cities also favor the center-left – especially public sector professionals, educators, and service industry employees who align with inclusive and welfare-oriented policies. For instance, capital cities like Madrid, Rome, Stockholm often have substantial support for social-democratic parties due to their diverse, younger, and more educated populations that lean progressive. Indeed, S&D’s platform of affordable housing and fair wages is directly aimed at urban middle and working classes struggling with costs of living
theparliamentmagazine.eu
.

Age-wise, the S&D has a somewhat bifurcated appeal. It retains a lot of older voters who have long-standing loyalty to social-democratic ideals (e.g., retirees who benefited from welfare states created by these parties). These older voters, often pensioners or near-retirement, trust the Socialists to protect pensions and healthcare. At the same time, the S&D tries to appeal to young adults concerned about climate change and social justice. In 2019, many under-30 voters swung to Greens and left-liberal parties, but in 2024 youth turnout fell and some of that “Generation Greta” disillusionment may have benefitted far-right protest votes instead
worldpoliticsreview.com
. The S&D likely did better among women than some other groups – progressive parties traditionally have stronger support among female voters, as women tend to favor welfare, education, and equality issues. The S&D’s emphasis on gender equality (e.g. closing the pay gap) is aimed at these voters
theparliamentmagazine.eu
. Meanwhile, among men, especially younger men, the S&D had more competition (some young male voters shifted to radical options in 2024
eprints.lse.ac.uk
).

Education and income: S&D voters range from low-income individuals to middle-income professionals. Many have at least secondary education; higher-educated progressives (like university students, academics, urban liberals) might choose Greens or Renew, but a share still vote Social Democrat especially in countries where those parties remain broad catch-alls. The S&D resonates with those who value a strong social safety net – this includes lower-educated voters in poorer regions (e.g. rural southern Italy or depressed post-industrial towns in Belgium) who rely on social programs, though some of these voters have been drifting to populist right parties blaming the establishment. It also includes young educated graduates who favor European solutions to inequality and climate (often splitting with Greens).

Geographically, the S&D base is often urban and industrial. Think of factory towns, mining regions (historically socialist strongholds), and big metropolitan areas with diverse populations. For example, in Spain, the Socialists do well among urban working-class neighborhoods and also with rural voters in poorer regions of the south; in Italy, the PD’s support centers in cities like Bologna, Milan (among liberal professionals) as well as some former “Red belt” areas. In Eastern Europe, social-democratic voters may include the older generation nostalgic for social protection, and minorities (e.g., Hungarian or Bulgarian minorities sometimes support left parties for their welfare stance). There is also an element of “progressive elite” vote – highly educated cosmopolitans (like some in Brussels, Paris) who support social democrats for their pro-EU and pro-rights agenda, although many in that profile now vote liberal/green.

Overall, the S&D’s electorate in 2024 can be characterized as workers, middle-income earners, and socially liberal citizens who prioritize solidarity. They are the segment of Europeans who favor policies like taxing the rich, protecting labor rights, and EU-wide social standards. With about 16% of voters Europe-wide, this coalition skews somewhat older and female compared to the far-right’s base, and heavily includes those in urban and industrial communities who have historically been the backbone of Europe’s social-democratic parties.
