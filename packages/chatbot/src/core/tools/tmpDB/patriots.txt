Patriots for Europe (Far-Right Nationalist Alliance)
Orientation and Ideology

Patriots for Europe (PfE) is the newly formed right-wing to far-right political group in the European Parliament, created after the 2024 elections. It is a coalition of nationalist, populist, and Eurosceptic parties that sit on the hard-right end of the spectrum
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Ideologically, this alliance espouses national conservatism, right-wing populism, and staunch Euroskepticism
en.wikipedia.org
. Its member parties are generally anti-federalist (critical of EU centralization and Brussels bureaucracy) and emphasize national sovereignty. They promote traditionalist values and often adopt anti-immigration, anti-Islam, and law-and-order rhetoric. Many also share a skeptical or hostile stance toward multiculturalism and what they term “woke” social policies, positioning themselves as defenders of a traditional European cultural identity.

Politically, the Patriots for Europe group can be seen as the successor to the prior “Identity and Democracy (ID)” group from 2019–2024
en.wikipedia.org
, but expanded to include new allies. It includes Marine Le Pen’s National Rally from France, Matteo Salvini’s League from Italy, Geert Wilders’ Party for Freedom (Netherlands), the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), Spain’s VOX, and Hungary’s Fidesz (PM Viktor Orbán’s party), among others
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. These parties are united by a Euroskeptic, nationalist worldview – they often accuse the EU of overreach and seek to return powers to member states. Many are also climate-skeptic or at least hostile to the EU’s Green Deal regulations, which they view as hurting farmers and businesses. In terms of left-right, they sit on the far-right: several member parties have been described as xenophobic or illiberal, and some have ties to authoritarian-friendly rhetoric (for instance, friendliness toward Russia or opposition to liberal democracy in the Orbán mold). The group’s own description (via a founding document) frames itself as a patriotic alternative defending “Europe of nations” against a federal superstate
en.wikipedia.org
.

In summary, Patriots for Europe’s ideology centers on national sovereignty, anti-immigration, cultural conservatism, and skepticism of EU authority, often coupled with right-wing populist positions like opposition to LGBTQ and gender policies, tough anti-crime stances, and economic protectionism. They range from hard Euroskeptics to borderline Europhobes, united by the goal of a looser EU that respects “European nations” and what they consider Europe’s traditional (Christian) heritage

2024 Policy Positions and Campaign Platform

Although the far-right parties did not issue a unified EU-wide manifesto before the election (they campaigned mostly on national manifestos), upon forming the Patriots for Europe group in July 2024 they released “A Patriotic Manifesto for a European Future,” outlining core positions
en.wikipedia.org
. The key policy themes of this alliance in the 2024 context were:

Weakening EU Central Power: The Patriots explicitly call for reducing the powers of Brussels and “returning competences to nation-states.” They oppose federalist steps and want to roll back EU integration in areas like migration, judiciary, and social policy
en.wikipedia.org
. Their vision is a Europe of sovereign nations cooperating loosely, rather than an “ever closer union.” This includes resistance to things like qualified-majority voting in foreign policy (they prefer national vetoes) and any future EU enlargements or treaties that deepen integration without national referenda.

Hardline Anti-Immigration Stance: Stopping immigration – especially from Muslim-majority countries – is at the top of their agenda. The Patriots for Europe manifesto emphasizes opposition to illegal immigration and calls for stringent border controls
en.wikipedia.org
. Member parties campaigned on slogans to “protect Europe’s borders” and have supported measures like border walls/fences, pushbacks of migrant boats, and offshoring asylum (even more staunchly than the EPP). For example, Marine Le Pen’s RN and VOX in Spain both ran on promises to halt immigration and deport illegal migrants, and these parties bring that stance into the PfE group. They also generally reject the EU’s asylum seeker distribution plans; instead, they advocate that each nation decide who enters, and many prefer a zero (non-European) immigration policy. Anti-refugee rhetoric – conflating immigration with security threats – is common in their platform.

“European Cultural Identity” and Traditional Values: The Patriots talk of defending Europe’s cultural heritage. This often translates into opposition to Islamism and a push for Christian/traditional norms. Many member parties are hostile to what they term “gender ideology” or progressive social changes. For instance, Poland’s PiS (which ultimately stayed in ECR, but VOX and others in PfE share similar views) attacks LGBT rights agendas; Italy’s Lega has opposed same-sex parent adoption, etc. While not explicitly in a common manifesto, the cultural conservative thrust is shared. Their manifesto does mention focusing on “European cultural identity” as a guiding idea
en.wikipedia.org
 – a phrase signaling policies that favor Europe’s “indigenous” traditions over multicultural or liberal trends.

Euro-skeptic Economic and Climate Policy: Economically, most of these parties favor protectionism and support for native industries. They often oppose free trade agreements and want to shield farmers and small businesses from global competition (hence Orbán, Le Pen, etc., criticize EU trade deals). On climate, they are critical of the Green Deal. The Patriots’ founding document calls for a “revision of the European Green Deal”
en.wikipedia.org
. Essentially, they argue the Green Deal’s environmental measures are overzealous and harm European industries and farmers. They lobby to overturn or soften regulations like emissions cuts, pesticide restrictions, or biodiversity laws. Some even deny or downplay climate change – for instance, AfD in Germany (though AfD didn’t formally join PfE, it’s aligned in ideology) outright rejects Germany’s climate policies. Overall, the PfE wants to put “farmers and jobs first” over climate goals. They also oppose EU plans to reduce car CO2 emissions or impose green tariffs, framing them as elite projects.

Foreign Policy Nationalism: Many in this group hold a friendlier line toward Russia (Le Pen’s party historically, Orbán’s Fidesz to an extent), though the war in Ukraine complicated this. They are generally less supportive of EU sanctions on Russia and skeptical of sending unlimited aid to Ukraine, often calling for peace negotiations. The PfE hasn’t issued a clear common Ukraine stance, but individual members (like AfD, which is separate but allied in spirit) called to stop arms shipments. They are also anti-China hawkishness to a lesser degree (some worry more about Islamic extremism than China). Essentially, “America First”-style Europe First thinking pervades – they want foreign policy that puts national interest above common EU positions. They also sometimes espouse Euroskeptic alliances: e.g., ties with other populist leaders (the Italian Lega admired Trump, etc.).

In summary, the campaign highlights for these far-right parties in 2024 were stopping immigration, reversing EU integration, attacking the Green Deal, and promoting nationalist social values
en.wikipedia.org
. The name “Patriots for Europe” itself underscores their framing: they present themselves as patriots saving Europe from the EU (which they paint as an elite project undermining nations). It’s a platform of Euro-realism or Euro-rejection, appealing to voters who are unhappy with the status quo and fear loss of national identity.

Historical Context and Formation

The rise of Patriots for Europe reflects the growing strength and convergence of Europe’s far-right. Historically, far-right and nationalist parties in the European Parliament were fragmented into multiple groups or sat as non-attached. Over the past two decades, however, they have steadily increased their presence – from small groupings like “Europe of Nations” in the early 2000s to larger alliances. In 2014, Marine Le Pen and allies formed the ENF (Europe of Nations and Freedom) group, which in 2019 became Identity and Democracy (ID) with 73 MEPs (including Le Pen’s RN, Salvini’s Lega, AfD, and others). The 2024 election further bolstered the far-right, and crucially, new heavyweights joined forces.

Patriots for Europe was formally launched in early July 2024 after negotiations among several right-wing leaders
en.wikipedia.org
. The initiative was spearheaded by Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán (Fidesz) and Andrej Babiš (leader of ANO in Czechia) together with Herbert Kickl of Austria’s FPÖ
en.wikipedia.org
. Orbán’s Fidesz had been without a European group since leaving the EPP in 2021, and Babiš’s ANO had just left the liberal Renew after the election
en.wikipedia.org
. They teamed up with the existing ID group parties to form a bigger alliance. On June 30, 2024, Orbán, Babiš, and Kickl held a press conference in Vienna announcing the plan and signing a joint “Patriotic Manifesto”
en.wikipedia.org
. Over the next week, a flurry of nationalist parties announced they would join the new group: Portugal’s Chega (July 1), Spain’s Vox (July 5, defecting from the ECR group)
en.wikipedia.org
, the Netherlands’ PVV (Geert Wilders)
en.wikipedia.org
, Denmark’s Danish People’s Party and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang (July 6)
en.wikipedia.org
, and finally on July 8 the largest two, National Rally (RN) of France and Lega of Italy, confirmed their membership
en.wikipedia.org
. This gave Patriots for Europe well above the required 7 countries and 23 MEPs to form an official group
en.wikipedia.org
. The group elected Jordan Bardella (Marine Le Pen’s protégé and president of RN) as its chairman
en.wikipedia.org
.

One notable aspect is which parties did not join: Germany’s AfD, despite being ideologically similar, did not immediately join PfE due to tensions (reportedly RN objected to AfD over extremist comments, and Orbán had past friction with AfD)
en.wikipedia.org
. AfD instead helped form a separate smaller group (Europe of Sovereign Nations) with some others
en.wikipedia.org
. Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) also stayed out – PiS initially negotiated with Orbán’s alliance but ultimately remained with Giorgia Meloni’s conservatives in ECR
en.wikipedia.org
. Nonetheless, PfE brought together the bulk of Europe’s far-right under one umbrella for the first time. It is effectively the largest nationalist/right-populist coalition ever seen in the Parliament.

Historically, this marks the culmination of the far-right’s steady mainstreaming. These parties have moved from pariahs to significant players – e.g., several are in national governments (Italy’s Meloni, though she is ECR not PfE; Poland’s PiS; the Finns Party until recently; etc.) and others are major opposition forces (Le Pen’s RN, the second-largest party in France). The formation of Patriots for Europe shows a new level of coordination among them. They even talk of coordinating beyond Parliament – Orbán has envisioned a broad nationalist front influencing the European Council and other institutions
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. However, internal differences (on allies like Russia, or economics) could still test the alliance’s cohesion.

In summary, Patriots for Europe’s formation in 2024 is a milestone in EU politics: the far-right coalescing into the third-largest bloc, born from the convergence of Le Pen’s and Orbán’s circles
worldpoliticsreview.com
. It reflects both the increasing electoral success of far-right parties and their attempt to unite to wield greater influence in Brussels. The group’s creation was underpinned by shared goals of reshaping the EU from within or at least obstructing further federal integration
en.wikipedia.org
.

Election Performance in 2024

The Patriots for Europe group came out of the 2024 elections as the third-largest bloc in the European Parliament
worldpoliticsreview.com
. Together, the parties now in PfE won roughly 84–85 seats (about 12% of the Parliament) – a gain of a few seats compared to the previous ID group
en.wikipedia.org
. They captured approximately 10.5% of the popular vote EU-wide
en.wikipedia.org
. This result marked a continuation of the far-right’s steady growth at the EU level.

By country, some notable performances underlie these numbers: France’s National Rally (RN) was a standout. Marine Le Pen’s party topped the poll in France, dealing a “trouncing” to President Macron’s centrist party
reuters.com
. RN’s strong finish (on the order of one-third of French votes) means it sent one of the largest national delegations to the PfE group. Italy’s Lega, on the other hand, did less well than in 2019 – Salvini’s party lost ground as many right-wing voters there shifted to Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy (which is in ECR). Nonetheless, Lega secured several MEPs who joined Patriots for Europe (Lega’s presence ensured Italy is represented in the group)
reuters.com
. Meanwhile, Hungary’s Fidesz won a sweeping victory domestically (Orbán’s party took most of Hungary’s 21 seats) and those MEPs joined PfE, instantly boosting its seat count by about a dozen
en.wikipedia.org
. This is significant, as Fidesz alone accounts for ~12 seats that were formerly in the EPP – a notable transfer from the center-right to the far-right camp.

In Austria, the Freedom Party (FPÖ) had a banner result, coming in second and winning 6 of Austria’s 19 seats (its best-ever EU election showing)
eprints.lse.ac.uk
eprints.lse.ac.uk
. These MEPs joined PfE and gave it a strong foothold in the German-speaking world. In Spain, Vox surged compared to 2019 and won around 3–4 seats, which it brought over from the ECR to the new PfE on July 5, 2024
en.wikipedia.org
. The Netherlands’ PVV returned to the Parliament with 1–2 seats (Wilders had had none in 2019, but after a resurgence in Dutch politics, PVV gained representation and joined PfE)
en.wikipedia.org
. Belgium’s Vlaams Belang maintained its 3 seats from Flanders, and Denmark’s DPP managed to secure 1 seat – both stayed aligned with the far-right faction
en.wikipedia.org
. Portugal’s Chega won 2 seats in its first European election and quickly affiliated with PfE
en.wikipedia.org
.

It’s important to note that the Patriots for Europe’s 84-seat count came after these post-election realignments. Immediately after the election, projections showed the far-right ID group at around 58 seats
reuters.com
, but that was before factoring in Fidesz, ANO and others. As the dust settled, PfE had 84, while another smaller far-right breakaway (the AfD-led “Europe of Sovereign Nations” group) took 25 seats
en.wikipedia.org
. Thus, the far-right in total is larger than any one group reflects; but PfE is the main nucleus, outstripping the older conservative Eurosceptic ECR group (which ended with 78 seats)
en.wikipedia.org
.

Country performance highlights: In Poland, although the ruling nationalist PiS didn’t join PfE, a fringe far-right Confederation party had some MEPs and one faction of it (the National Movement) later joined PfE
en.wikipedia.org
. In Germany, as noted, AfD’s 15 MEPs did not join PfE (due to internal politics), which somewhat undercounts PfE’s potential strength – had AfD been included, PfE would be even larger. Nonetheless, PfE’s absence of AfD means Germany is one big member state without PfE representation (AfD sits in a different far-right group). Central/Eastern Europe: besides Hungary, the group also features members from Czechia (Andrej Babiš’s ANO won 7 seats and switched allegiance from liberal Renew to PfE
en.wikipedia.org
) and Bulgaria (the Revival party with a few seats reportedly joined the separate AfD-linked group instead
en.wikipedia.org
). There were ongoing efforts to recruit others (for example, the group courted Slovakia’s nationalist parties and a Slovenian party, though those did not materialize at the time)
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
.

In sum, the 2024 election cemented the far-right as a powerful force: Patriots for Europe came in third with ~84 seats, behind only EPP and S&D
en.wikipedia.org
. This was hailed by its members as a great success – a decade prior, such an alliance was unthinkable. Now Le Pen’s party alone will hold roughly half of all French seats, Salvini’s and Orbán’s contributions are sizable, and the group boasts MEPs from 13 EU countries in total
en.wikipedia.org
. Their performance by country shows strength in France, Hungary, Austria, Italy (to a lesser extent), and notable presence in Spain, Poland (potentially later), Netherlands, etc. The far-right’s gains came partly at the expense of traditional parties (EPP and S&D lost some votes to them) and also due to a collapse of some liberal and Green votes (voter anxieties over inflation and migration favored the rightward shift)
reuters.com
reuters.com
. As Cas Mudde noted, “far-right parties won roughly a quarter of the vote” across Europe in 2024 – though split in different groups, their collective weight is significant
journalofdemocracy.org
. Patriots for Europe embodies the largest share of that.

Voter Base Demographics

The voter base of the Patriots for Europe (far-right) alliance is typically characterized by high levels of resentment toward the political establishment, concerns about immigration, and cultural anxiety. Demographically, these parties have historically drawn disproportionately from certain groups, though 2024 showed their appeal is broadening. Key traits of the far-right electorate include:

Age: Contrary to earlier stereotypes of the far-right appealing mainly to older voters, the 2024 elections revealed a surge of youth support for far-right parties. Election data showed a “double-digit rise in support” for parties like Germany’s AfD and France’s RN among voters under 30
worldpoliticsreview.com
. In fact, research indicates far-right parties achieved unprecedented levels of backing from young Europeans in 2024. This was especially driven by young men: about 21% of young men (under 30) voted for far-right parties, compared to 14% of young women – a sizeable gender gap among youth
eprints.lse.ac.uk
. The factors behind youth attraction include frustration with economic prospects (post-COVID and amid a cost-of-living crisis) and disillusionment with mainstream politics
worldpoliticsreview.com
. That said, the far-right still maintains support from middle-aged and older voters too. Many older voters, particularly those with more conservative or traditionalist mindsets, remain part of the base – for example, Le Pen has significant support among French retirees on modest pensions (drawn by her promises of welfare for natives and anti-EU rhetoric on prices). So, the age profile is now a mix: strong representation of the 18–35 cohort (especially men) alongside a loyal following among the over-50s who harbor nostalgic or nationalist sentiments. The group weakest for far-right parties tends to be the very elderly (who often stick with established parties or abstain) and young progressive women (who lean left/Green).

Gender: As noted, there is a pronounced male skew in far-right support. Men, feeling attracted to hard-line messages on security or national pride, vote for these parties at higher rates than women
eprints.lse.ac.uk
. The youth gender gap is striking, but even in older age groups, men are more likely to back nationalist populists. Women are generally less supportive, possibly due to the far-right’s often macho image and policies that downplay gender equality. Some far-right parties have tried to soften their image to win more female voters (Marine Le Pen, for instance, focused on cost-of-living and welfare issues to appeal to women), but overall the “angry white male” archetype still holds some truth. That said, 2024’s broadening means far-right voters are not exclusively male – they have gained some female voters fed up with crime or who support anti-immigration stances, just in smaller proportions than male voters.

Education and Income: Far-right parties tend to perform strongly among those with lower education levels and those in economically precarious positions. Many of their voters are blue-collar workers, small craftsmen, or unemployed individuals who feel left behind by globalization. They speak to the “losers of modernization and globalization,” offering scapegoats (immigrants, EU elites) for economic grievances
eprints.lse.ac.uk
eprints.lse.ac.uk
. For example, in France the RN is now the top party among working-class voters and those without college degrees. Similarly, AfD’s support is concentrated among Germans with vocational education rather than university degrees. Income-wise, far-right voters often fall in the lower-middle or lower income brackets – they might have jobs but feel financially insecure, or live on modest pensions/benefits. However, there is also a component of petite bourgeoisie (small business owners, self-employed) who resent regulations and taxes; this group (e.g. rural shopkeepers, farmers) also backs the far-right in some countries. The highly educated and high-income voters are generally less drawn to far-right appeals (they tend to favor EPP or liberal parties), though a minority of well-off voters do support nationalist parties out of ideological conviction or tax considerations.

Urban/Rural Divide: Far-right support is often stronger in rural areas, small towns, and deindustrialized regions than in large, cosmopolitan cities. These parties thrive in areas that feel neglected by metropolitan elites. For instance, Le Pen’s RN dominates in parts of rural northern and eastern France – former industrial heartlands with high unemployment. AfD leads in many parts of rural East Germany. Vox does well in more traditional, rural regions of Spain (and less in big cities like Barcelona). These regions often have less exposure to immigrants (ironically) but a greater sense of cultural threat or abandonment. On the other hand, the far-right also has a presence in outer city suburbs or peri-urban areas – places just outside major cities where middle and working-class commuters live, sometimes experiencing social problems. In contrast, the cores of global cities (Paris, Berlin, Madrid) with diverse, university-educated populations tend to reject the far-right; these voters are more likely to support left, liberal, or green parties. Thus, PfE’s voter map is a checkerboard of peripheral France/inner Paris divide, rural East vs urban West in Germany, etc., generally highlighting that rural and exurban communities are fertile ground for their message.

Attitudes and Issues: Beyond demographics, it’s the mindset that defines the far-right voter. Surveys consistently show that PfE/far-right voters are highly concerned about immigration (they believe it’s a threat to security, jobs, and national identity) and about cultural change. They also exhibit lower trust in the EU and often in democracy itself. Indeed, frustration with mainstream parties and perceived lack of voice drives many to these “anti-establishment” options – a form of protest voting
europarl.europa.eu
. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, as noted by analysts, “fueled far-right radicalization” among some – undermining young people’s trust in authorities and making extreme alternatives attractive
worldpoliticsreview.com
. Economic anxieties (inflation, cost-of-living) also push voters toward the far-right, who blame ruling elites for these issues. For example, young people hit by precarious job markets swung to RN and AfD because they felt mainstream social-democrats or liberals failed them
worldpoliticsreview.com
. In essence, the far-right voter base is defined by a sense of grievance – they feel unsafe (physically or culturally), economically insecure, and disconnected from cosmopolitan elites. Demographically, this often correlates with being male, less educated, from smaller communities, and of modest means, but increasingly it spans young to middle-aged adults who share those grievances across genders and classes.
