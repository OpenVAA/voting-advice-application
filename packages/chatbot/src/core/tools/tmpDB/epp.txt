European People’s Party (EPP)
Orientation and Ideology

The European People’s Party is a center-right, pro-European political family rooted in Christian democracy and liberal-conservative ideals. It represents mainstream conservative parties across Europe, such as Germany’s CDU/CSU, Spain’s Partido Popular, and others. The EPP emphasizes traditional values, market-oriented economic policies, and European integration. It is generally moderate in tone – positioning itself as a bulwark against extremism – and has historically been pro-EU, though it grew somewhat more skeptical of aggressive climate policies in recent years

2024 Key Policy Positions and Platform

Ahead of the 2024 election, the EPP adopted a manifesto titled “Our Europe, a safe and good home for the people.” The campaign centered on three core issues: migration, climate, and defense
euronews.com
. On migration, the EPP took a hard line, championing the reinforcement of “Fortress Europe.” It proposed outsourcing asylum processing to third countries (in a controversial “Rwanda model” akin to the UK plan) and sealing deals with transit countries (like the EU-Tunisia accord) to curb irregular immigration

. The EPP presented itself as a pragmatic middle-ground on migration – criticizing the far right for offering no constructive solutions and the left for being too lax – and vowed to reduce illegal arrivals while upholding asylum rights

.

On climate policy, the EPP officially remained committed to the European Green Deal’s goals but advocated a more growth-friendly “next phase” of the Green Deal

. EPP leaders had faced criticism for pushing back on certain green regulations (for example, many EPP MEPs tried to block the Nature Restoration Law in 2023), reflecting farm sector backlash

. In its manifesto the EPP tried to “tread a tightrope” – pledging to meet climate targets, but with a greater emphasis on technological innovation “made in Europe” to enhance competitiveness, and more financial support for farmers, fishers, and small businesses to adapt to the green transition

. Notably, a leaked draft proposal to roll back the EU’s 2035 combustion-engine car ban was dropped in the final text, which instead insisted that engineers and markets (rather than politicians alone) should decide the best path to carbon neutrality

. This nuanced stance signaled the EPP’s intent to balance environmental ambition with economic and rural interests.

On defense and foreign policy, the EPP significantly ramped up its ambitions in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The 2024 platform called for Europe to “defend itself” more effectively
euronews.com
. The EPP proposed creating a dedicated EU Commissioner for Security and Defense, a “Single Market for Defence”, and even a new EU defense budget pot within the multi-annual budget

. It advocated closer European defense industrial cooperation (including joint arms procurement and prioritizing European-made military equipment) and suggested moving toward qualified-majority voting on certain foreign policy decisions to prevent single-member-state vetoes

. The EPP also supports NATO expansion and strong transatlantic ties. Additionally, it favors deepening the European single market and expanding free trade agreements

Historical Evolution in EU Politics

The EPP has been the dominant force in European Parliament politics for decades. Founded as a European party in 1976, it united center-right and Christian-democratic parties from the member states. Since the 1990s, the EPP Group has consistently been the largest faction in Parliament, often forming a “grand coalition” with the Socialists. It has played a central role in EU policymaking and in selecting the leadership of EU institutions. European Commission presidents from Jacques Delors to José Manuel Barroso, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Ursula von der Leyen have come from the EPP’s ranks, reflecting its leading status in EU governance. Historically, the EPP championed European integration (the EPP was a driving force behind the Maastricht Treaty and EU enlargement) and influenced key initiatives like the single market and, more recently, the EU’s COVID recovery plan and climate agenda

.

However, the EPP’s dominance has been challenged in recent years by the fragmentation of European politics. In the 2019 election, the EPP lost seats amid a surge of liberals (Renew) and Greens, and internal tensions emerged, e.g. over Hungary’s Fidesz party. (Fidesz, led by Viktor Orbán, was suspended and eventually quit the EPP in 2021 over rule-of-law disputes and has since aligned with the far-right bloc

.) Going into 2024, the EPP repositioned itself slightly to the right on certain issues like migration and climate in an effort to recapture voters drifting toward nationalist or skeptic parties

. Despite these pressures, the EPP’s pro-EU, center-right identity remains fundamentally unchanged – it continues to evolve as a broad church of moderate conservatives, from more liberal centrists to more traditional Christian-democrats, unified by a commitment to the European project albeit with calls for some reforms.

Election Performance in 2024

In the 2024 elections, the EPP reinforced its status as the largest group in the European Parliament
reuters.com
. It won 188 seats out of 720 (slightly up from the previous Parliament)
en.wikipedia.org
. Collectively, EPP-affiliated parties obtained roughly 19.6% of the popular vote EU-wide
en.wikipedia.org
 – the highest share for any party family. This solid performance was aided by strong showings in several major member states. Germany (which elects 96 MEPs) contributed the single largest contingent – the EPP’s German member (the CDU/CSU) dominated with around 29 seats, keeping the group “dominated by German Christian Democrats”
reuters.com
. The EPP also led the polls in countries like Austria (where the centre-right ÖVP won first place), Ireland, and did well in Central-Eastern Europe. In Poland, the Civic Coalition (KO) and Polish People’s Party (PSL) together gave the EPP a significant bloc of MEPs (Poland’s EPP delegation was the second-largest after Germany)

. In Spain, the Partido Popular surged compared to 2019, securing one of the top two spots nationally and contributing substantially to the EPP’s count
reuters.com
. However, in France and some other countries, EPP affiliates struggled (France’s traditional conservative Les Républicains performed poorly, yielding few MEPs). Overall, the EPP’s geographic base in 2024 remained broad: it pulled strong support in German-speaking Europe, parts of Southern Europe (Spain, Portugal’s PSD, Greece’s New Democracy), and much of Eastern Europe, though it faced competition from far-right lists in France, Italy, and elsewhere.

Importantly, while the EPP gained a few seats, its longstanding “grand coalition” with S&D and Renew lost ground overall. The EPP+S&D+Renew alliance retained a majority, but a slimmer one than before, due to losses by S&D and Renew

. The EPP’s lead candidate (Spitzenkandidat) in 2024 was incumbent Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen’s high profile and the EPP’s promise of stability may have helped maintain its vote share. The country-by-country performance shows EPP came first in about 8 of the 27 member states
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. It notably held its ground in Italy (where Forza Italia and allied centrists secured seats) and Hungary (though Fidesz left EPP, another smaller Hungarian party remained with EPP). In summary, the EPP emerged from 2024 with 188 MEPs and remained the Parliament’s largest group, positioning it to claim influential posts and coalition leadership once again

Voter Base Demographics

The EPP’s electorate tends to be older and more traditionally conservative than the overall population. Turnout in 2024 skewed toward older, higher-income citizens
europarl.europa.eu
, which benefited pro-EU mainstream parties like the EPP. In many countries, the EPP’s member parties draw strong support from elderly voters and pensioners, who often favor stability and have longstanding loyalties to center-right parties. The EPP also does well among rural and small-town voters, particularly in regions with a Christian-democratic voting tradition (for example, rural Bavaria for the CSU, or Catholic rural areas of Spain and Poland) – these voters appreciate the EPP’s emphasis on family, faith, and local community values. Practicing religious communities (churchgoers) in some countries form a core EPP constituency. Socioeconomically, EPP voters often include the middle class and business-friendly demographics: for instance, entrepreneurs, farmers, and professionals who favor the EPP’s pro-market and pro-free trade policies
theparliamentmagazine.eu
. Education levels among EPP voters vary – many are well-educated (especially among urban moderates and professionals), but the EPP also captures moderately educated voters outside big cities.

Gender-wise, the EPP does not exhibit as stark a gender gap as far-right parties; its support is relatively balanced between men and women. If anything, men in some countries lean slightly toward the EPP’s law-and-order messaging, whereas some women voters in the center-right orbit have shifted to liberal or green parties in recent years. Urban vs. rural divides are notable: urban conservative voters exist (especially wealthier neighborhoods, older generations), but urban electorates nowadays often lean liberal or left. The EPP’s heartlands are frequently non-metropolitan areas and smaller cities. For example, in Poland’s 2024 vote, the EPP-aligned Civic Coalition drew heavy support from urban liberals, but in Germany the CDU/CSU vote was strong in countryside and provincial towns. Income and class: EPP voters span middle to upper income brackets – they include both white-collar workers and owners of small and medium enterprises. Their common thread is a preference for moderate, mainstream governance and skepticism of radical changes. Indeed, political scientists note that “established pro-EU parties retained support” chiefly from voters content with the status quo, while protest voters went elsewhere
europarl.europa.eu
. In summary, the EPP base in 2024 was anchored by older, middle-class, and rural/suburban constituencies who value the EPP’s blend of economic stability, incremental reform, and traditional social values.
