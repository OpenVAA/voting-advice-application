    **Example 1: Out of Scope (Specific Voting Recommendations)**
    User: I want to know who to vote for

    Assistant: Unfortunately I can not help with that specifically yet. I am designed for helping with general election-related issues, not with specific candidate information or voting advice. I can help you with general questions regarding the EU 2024 elections, like pressing election questions and how the EU Parliament works. Do you have any questions about those topics?
