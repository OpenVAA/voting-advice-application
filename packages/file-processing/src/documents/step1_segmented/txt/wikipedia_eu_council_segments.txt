=== SEGMENT 1 ===
[Summary: The European Council (EUCO) is the symbolic collective head of state for the EU, defining its overall political direction and general priorities. It is composed of the heads of state or government of member states, the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Established informally in 1975, the Council was formalized as an institution in 2009 by the Treaty of Lisbon, and its current president is António Costa.]

The European Council (informally EUCO) is a collegiate body (directorial system) and a symbolic collective head of state, that defines the overall political direction and general priorities of the European Union (EU). It is composed of the heads of state or of government of the EU member states, the president of the European Council, and the president of the European Commission. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also takes part in its meetings.[1]Established as an informal summit in 1975, the European Council was formalised as an institution in 2009 upon the commencement of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its current president is António Costa, former prime minister of Portugal.


=== SEGMENT 2 ===
[Summary: The European Council serves as a strategic and crisis-solving body that defines the EU's general political directions and priorities, acting as a collective presidency despite having no formal legislative power. While the European Commission remains the sole initiator of legislation, the Council guides policy and has been dubbed "the law-maker-in-chief." Its meetings, commonly called EU summits, occur at least twice every six months, usually in the Europa building in Brussels, and decisions are generally taken by consensus.]

Scope
While the European Council has no legislative power, it is a strategic (and crisis-solving) body that provides the union with general political directions and priorities, and acts as a collective presidency. The European Commission remains the sole initiator of legislation, but the European Council provides a guide to legislative policy and has been called "the law-maker-in-chief".[2][3][4]

The meetings of the European Council, still commonly referred to as EU summits, are chaired by its president and take place at least twice every six months;[1] usually in the Europa building in Brussels.[5][6] Decisions of the European Council are taken by consensus, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.[7]


=== SEGMENT 3 ===
[Summary: The European Council officially gained institutional status, separate from the Council of Ministers, following the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007. Its history began with informal summits in 1961, which were initiated by French President Charles de Gaulle. A significant early event was the 1969 Hague summit, which agreed upon the admittance of the United Kingdom and started foreign policy cooperation.]

History
Further information: List of European Council meetings
The European Council officially gained the status of an EU institution after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, distinct from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits of the leaders of the European Community, and were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (notably the European Commission) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the European Political Cooperation) taking integration beyond economics.[1][8]


=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: The European Council summits were formalized between 1974 and 1988, beginning with the December 1974 Paris summit which agreed on the need for high-level political input. The inaugural European Council meeting took place in Dublin in March 1975. The Council's status was gradually cemented, being included in the treaties for the first time in 1987 via the Single European Act, and its seat was formally established in Brussels in 2002.]

The summits were only formalised in the period between 1974 and 1988. At the December summit in Paris in 1974, following a proposal from then-French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, it was agreed that more high-level, political input was needed following the "empty chair crisis" and economic problems.[9] The inaugural European Council, as it became known, was held in Dublin on 10 and 11 March 1975 during Ireland's first Presidency of the Council of Ministers. In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the Single European Act) and had a defined role for the first time in the Maastricht Treaty. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975–1995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008–2014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The seat of the Council was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels.


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: European Council meetings are classified into three types: Informal, Scheduled, and Extraordinary, differentiated primarily by their scheduling and the nature of their outcomes, such as whether they conclude with official Council conclusions or broad political statements. The segment also lists several historical meetings considered turning points in the history of the European Union, including the 1974 Paris meeting which led to the Council's creation, and the 1985 Milan meeting which initiated the process for the Single European Act.]

Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1½ years in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official Council conclusions, as they instead end by more broad political Statements on some cherry-picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings always end with official Council conclusions but differ from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union's response to the 11 September attacks.[1][8]

Some meetings of the European Council—and, before the European Council was formalised, meetings of the heads of government—are seen by some as turning points in the history of the European Union. For example:[1]

1969, The Hague: Foreign policy and enlargement.
1974, Paris: Creation of the council.
1985, Milan: Initiate IGC leading to the Single European Act.


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: This segment details significant European Council meetings between 1991 and 2010, which served as major turning points for the European Union. Key outcomes included the agreement on foundational treaties like the Maastricht Treaty (1991) and the Lisbon Treaty (2007), the definition of the Copenhagen Criteria (1993), and the selection of member states to adopt the euro (1998). The period also saw agreements on institutional matters, such as retaining Strasbourg as the Parliament's seat and the appointment of the first permanent president in 2009, alongside the establishment of the European Financial Stability Facility in 2010.]

=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: The European Council existed prior to the Treaty of Lisbon but could only issue political decisions, requiring the Heads of State or Government to formally meet as the Council of Ministers to enact legal acts. The Treaty of Lisbon formalized the European Council as an EU institution, granting it the authority to take formal, legally binding decisions, thereby replacing the previous complex arrangement.]

As such, the European Council had already existed before it gained the status as an institution of the European Union with the entering into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, but even after it had been mentioned in the treaties (since the Single European Act) it could only take political decisions, not formal legal acts. However, when necessary, the Heads of State or Government could also meet as the Council of Ministers and take formal decisions in that role. Sometimes, this was even compulsory, e.g. Article 214(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provided (before it was amended by the Treaty of Lisbon) that 'the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government and acting by a qualified majority, shall nominate the person it intends to appoint as President of the Commission' (emphasis added); the same rule applied in some monetary policy provisions introduced by the Maastricht Treaty (e.g. Article 109j TEC). In that case, what was politically part of a European Council meeting was legally a meeting of the Council of Ministers. When the European Council, already introduced into the treaties by the Single European Act, became an institution by virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, this was no longer necessary, and the "Council [of the European Union] meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government", was replaced in these instances by the European Council now taking formal legally binding decisions in these cases (Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union).[11]


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon formalized the European Council as an institution distinct from the Council of the EU and established a new, full-time presidency. This system involves appointing an individual for a renewable two-and-a-half-year term, replacing the previous rotating presidency. Herman Van Rompuy, the former Prime Minister of Belgium, was elected as the first permanent president following the treaty's ratification in December 2009.]

The Treaty of Lisbon made the European Council a formal institution distinct from the (ordinary) Council of the EU, and created the present longer term and full-time presidency. As an outgrowth of the Council of the EU, the European Council had previously followed the same Presidency, rotating between each member state. While the Council of the EU retains that system, the European Council established, with no change in powers, a system of appointing an individual (without them being a national leader) for a two-and-a-half-year term—which can be renewed for the same person only once.[12] Following the ratification of the treaty in December 2009, the European Council elected the then-Prime Minister of Belgium Herman Van Rompuy as its first permanent president; he resigned the prime ministerial position.[13]


=== SEGMENT 9 ===
[Summary: The European Council is an official EU institution whose primary role, as defined by the Lisbon Treaty, is to provide the necessary impetus for the Union's development. It essentially defines the EU's policy agenda and is often considered the motor of European integration. Beyond providing impetus, its functions include settling outstanding issues from lower-level discussions, leading foreign policy (acting as a "collective Head of State"), formally ratifying important documents, and involvement in negotiating treaty changes.]

Powers and functions
The European Council is an official institution of the EU, described in the Lisbon Treaty as a body which "shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development". Essentially it defines the EU's policy agenda and has thus been considered to be the motor of European integration.[1] Beyond the need to provide "impetus", the council has developed further roles: to "settle issues outstanding from discussions at a lower level", to lead in foreign policy — acting externally as a "collective Head of State", "formal ratification of important documents" and "involvement in the negotiation of the treaty changes".[5][8]


=== SEGMENT 10 ===
[Summary: The European Council, composed of national leaders, wields significant executive influence, particularly in high-profile areas like foreign policy. It holds key appointment powers, including selecting its own President, the High Representative, and the President of the European Central Bank, and proposes the Commission President candidate to the European Parliament. Although it lacks direct legislative power, it can review contentious legislation via the "emergency brake" procedure, leading some to label it the Union's "supreme political authority."]

Since the institution is composed of national leaders, it gathers the executive power of the member states and has thus a great influence in high-profile policy areas as for example foreign policy. It also exercises powers of appointment, such as appointment of its own President, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the President of the European Central Bank. It proposes, to the European Parliament, a candidate for President of the European Commission. Moreover, the European Council influences police and justice planning, the composition of the commission, matters relating to the organisation of the rotating Council presidency, the suspension of membership rights, and changing the voting systems through the Passerelle Clause. Although the European Council has no direct legislative power, under the "emergency brake" procedure, a state outvoted in the Council of Ministers may refer contentious legislation to the European Council. However, the state may still be outvoted in the European Council.[12][14][15] Hence with powers over the supranational executive of the EU, in addition to its other powers, the European Council has been described by some as the Union's "supreme political authority".[5][8][12][16]


=== SEGMENT 11 ===
[Summary: The European Council is composed of the heads of state or government of the member states. It also includes its own President and the President of the European Commission, both of whom are non-voting members.]

Composition
The European Council consists of the heads of state or government of the member states, alongside its own President and the Commission President (both non-voting). The meetings used to be regularly attended b


=== SEGMENT 12 ===
[Summary: The composition of European Council meetings was streamlined following the Treaty of Lisbon, which discontinued the attendance of national foreign ministers and additional Commission members due to the body's increasing size after successive EU accessions. Current attendees include the Secretary-General of the Council, who manages organizational matters, and the President of the European Parliament, who delivers an opening speech outlining the Parliament's position. Other invitees, such as the President of the European Central Bank, may also attend as required.]

y the national foreign minister as well, and the Commission President likewise accompanied by another member of the commission. However, since the Treaty of Lisbon, this has been discontinued, as the size of the body had become somewhat large following successive accessions of new Member States to the Union.[1][5] Meetings can also include other invitees, such as the President of the European Central Bank, as required. The Secretary-General of the Council attends, and is responsible for organisational matters, including minutes. The President of the European Parliament also attends to give an opening speech outlining the European Parliament's position before talks begin.[1][5]


=== SEGMENT 13 ===
[Summary: European Council negotiations rely on a large support staff working behind the scenes, though access to the conference room is highly restricted, typically allowing only two delegates per state to relay messages. Members can consult the "Antici Group"—a team of diplomats and assistants in an adjacent room—for advice. Interpreters are also essential, ensuring members are permitted to speak in their native languages.]

Additionally, the negotiations involve a large number of other people working behind the scenes. Most of those people, however, are not allowed to the conference room, except for two delegates per state to relay messages. At the push of a button members can also call for advice from a Permanent Representative via the "Antici Group" in an adjacent room. The group is composed of diplomats and assistants who convey information and requests. Interpreters are also required for meetings as members are permitted to speak in their own languages.[1]


=== SEGMENT 14 ===
[Summary: The lack of a precisely defined composition for Council meetings creates difficulties for states with divided executive power in determining who should attend. This issue was exemplified in Finland in 2008 during the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis, where Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb was excluded because both the President and the Prime Minister insisted on attending, exceeding the two-person limit per country.]

As the composition is not precisely defined, some states which have a considerable division of executive power can find it difficult to decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that there was no need for the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy).[17] In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings).[citation needed] This was despite Stubb being Chair-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis.


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: The segment first details political conflicts in Poland and Romania, where Presidents and Prime Ministers from opposing parties clashed over foreign policy responses and representation at meetings. It then introduces Eurozone summits, noting that ad hoc meetings were held in 2010 and 2011 to discuss the Sovereign Debt crisis. Following this, it was agreed in October 2011 that these summits would meet regularly twice a year, restricted to the heads of state or government of the Eurozone member states, and chaired by the President of the European Council.]

Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis.[18] A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.[citation needed]

Eurozone summits
Main article: Euro summit
A number of ad hoc meetings of heads of state or government of the member states of the euro area were held in 2010 and 2011 to discuss the Sovereign Debt crisis. It was agreed in October 2011 that they should meet regularly twice a year (with extra meetings if needed). This will normally be at the end of a European Council meeting and according to the same format (chaired by the President of the European Council and including the President of the Commission), but usually restricted to the (currently 20) heads of state or government of the member states of the eurozone.[citation needed]


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: The President of the European Council is elected by the Heads of State or Government via a qualified majority vote for a once-renewable term of two and a half years. The duties of this office, which was created by the Treaty of Lisbon, are identified in Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The President is also required to report to the European Parliament after every European Council meeting.]

President
Main article: President of the European Council
The President of the European Council is elected by its members through a qualified majority vote for a once-renewable term of two and a half years. Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) identifies his duties. It is the Heads of State or Government who vote for this office.[19] The President must report to the European Parliament after each European Council meeting.[5][16] The post was created by the Treaty of Lisbon and was subject to a debate over its exact role.


=== SEGMENT 17 ===
[Summary: Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Council Presidency rotated, and the President-in-Office functioned as a primus inter pares without executive powers, primarily preparing and chairing meetings while representing the Union externally. The segment then lists current members of the European Council, including the non-voting Presidents of the European Council (António Costa) and the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen), along with the heads of government for Austria, Belgium, and Bulgaria.]

Prior to Lisbon, the Presidency rotated in accordance with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.[5][16] The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an office of a head of state, merely a primus inter pares (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task of representing the Union externally. Now the leader of the Council Presidency country can still act as president when the permanent president is absent.[citation needed]

[Summary: The segment provides historical notes on the previous tenures of several current European Council members, detailing their past roles, such as Costa's time as Prime Minister of Portugal and Tusk's service as both Prime Minister of Poland and President of the European Council. It then introduces the topic of political alliances, noting that almost all European Council members belong to a national political party, and most are also affiliated with European-level alliances like European political parties or political groups of the European Parliament.]

Notes
 Costa had already been a member of the Council from November 2015 to April 2024 as Prime Minister of Portugal.
 Mitsotakis had already been Prime Minister of Greece, and therefore a member of the Council, from July 2019 to May 2023.
 Martin had already been Taoiseach, and therefore a member of the Council, from June 2020 to December 2022.
 Tusk had already been a member of the Council from November 2007 to September 2014 as Prime Minister of Poland, and from December 2014 to November 2019 as President of the European Council.
 Fico had already been Prime Minister of Slovakia, and therefore a member of the Council, from July 2006 to July 2010 and from April 2012 to March 2018.


Political alliances

European political affiliation of the current members of the European Council
Almost all members of the European Council are members of a political party at the national level. Most of them are also members of political alliances at the European level such as European political parties and political groups of the European Parliament.


=== SEGMENT 22 ===
[Summary: Political alliances frequently organize pre-meetings for their European Council members, but members officially represent their respective member states, meaning decisions are generally made along national lines, though ideology can influence agreements and appointments. The segment provides a breakdown of members by political group, showing the EPP holds the largest affiliation with 11 members (40.7%).]

These alliances frequently hold pre-meetings with their European Council members, prior to their meetings. However, the members of the European Council represent their member states rather than political alliances, and decisions are generally made along national lines, though ideological alignment can colour political agreements and appointments (such as the president of the European Council).[20]

The charts below outline the number of leaders affiliated to each alliance and their total voting weight. The map indicates the political group of the member representing each individual country.

[Summary: The venue for European Council summits shifted from the member state holding the rotating Presidency to Brussels, a change agreed upon during the ratification of the Nice Treaty to take effect when EU membership exceeded 18 states. This transition began in 2002 and was fully implemented after the 2004 enlargement, driven by logistical, financial, and security concerns. This move is interpreted by some scholars as an institutionalization of the European Council, reinforcing national leaders' dominance as the EU's supreme political authority.]

ue for European Council summits was the member state that held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during ratification of the Nice Treaty to forego this arrangement at such a time as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states.[30] An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location.[31] Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta.[32] The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council.[8] Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the formalisation of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an institutionalisation of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in Luxembourg compromise, with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU's "supreme political authority".[8]


=== SEGMENT 25 ===
[Summary: The European Council and the Council of the European Union initially shared the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, which underwent renovations, including converting a carpark into press rooms. However, logistical issues led leaders in 2004 to approve the construction of a new purpose-built facility designed to handle nearly 6,000 annual meetings.

Originally, both the European Council and the Council of the European Union utilised the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue. In order to make room for additional meeting space a number of renovations were made, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional press briefing rooms.[33] However, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted the construction of a new purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year.[6] This resulted in the Europa building, which opened its doors in 2017. The focal point of the new building, the distinctive multi-storey "lantern-shaped" structure in which the main meeting room is located, is utilised in both the European Council's and Council of the European Union's official logos.[34]
