=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: The core function of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is to ensure that EU law is observed in the interpretation and application of the Treaties, achieved by reviewing institutional legality, enforcing member state compliance, and interpreting EU law. Historically, the CJEU was established in 1951 as the Court of Justice of the European Coal and Steel Communities, undergoing several structural additions and name changes, culminating in the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon renaming the system. The working language of the CJEU is French.]

Function
The CJEU's specific mission is to ensure that "the law is observed" "in the interpretation and application" of the Treaties of the European Union. To achieve this, it:

reviews the legality of actions taken by the EU's institutions;
enforces compliance by member states with their obligations under the Treaties, and
interprets European Union law.[4]
The composition and functioning of the courts are regulated by the Rules of Procedure.[14]

History
The CJEU was originally established in 1951 as a single court called the Court of Justice of the European Coal and Steel Communities. With the Euratom and the European Economic Community in 1957 its name changed to the Court of Justice of the European Communities (CJEC).[14] In 1988 the Court requested the Commission to create a Court of First Instance and in 2004 it added the Civil Service Tribunal.[14] The Civil Service Tribunal are for issues of public employment.

The Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 renamed the court system to the "Court of Justice of the European Union" and renamed the CJEC to the "Court of Justice".

The working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union is French.
