[Summary: The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states, covering 4,233,255 km2 and estimated to hold a population of over 450 million by 2025. It is a major global economic power, generating approximately one sixth of global economic output, with member states producing a nominal GDP of around €17.935 trillion in 2024. The EU's foundation, the Customs Union, established an internal single market whose policies ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital, while also maintaining common legislation in areas like justice, trade, and agriculture.]

The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe.[8][9] The Union has a total area of 4,233,255 km2 (1,634,469 sq mi) and an estimated population of more than 450 million as of 2025. The EU is often described as a sui generis political entity combining characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.[10][11]Containing 5.5% of the world population in 2023,[12] EU member states generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around €17.935 trillion in 2024, accounting for approximately one sixth of global economic output.[13] Its cornerstone, the Customs Union, paved the way to establishing an internal single market based on standardised legal framework and legislation that applies in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market;[14] enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade,[15] agriculture,[16] fisheries, and regional development.[17]


=== SEGMENT 2 ===
[Summary: The segment details key operational components and the foundational history of the EU. It notes the existence of the Schengen Area, where passport controls are abolished, and the eurozone, which includes 20 member states using the euro currency. Historically, the EU was established with the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, achieving international legal personhood in 2009 via the Treaty of Lisbon, and traces its origins back to the Inner Six states and entities like the European Coal and Steel Community.]

Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.[18] The eurozone is a group composed of the 20 EU member states that have fully implemented the EU's economic and monetary union and use the euro currency. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence. It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The EU was established, along with its citizenship, when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, and was incorporated as an international legal juridical person[clarification needed] upon entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.[19] Its beginnings can be traced to the Inner Six states (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) at the start of modern European integration in 1948, and to the Western Union, the International Authority for the Ruhr, the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, which were established by treaties.


=== SEGMENT 3 ===
[Summary: The European Union, as the legal successor to earlier amalgamated bodies, expanded significantly in size and power between 1973 and 2013 through the accession of 22 states. While ten countries are currently aspiring to join, the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU in 2020. Historically, the drive for European integration gained momentum after World War I, leading to early proposals like John Maynard Keynes's 1920 suggestion for a European customs union and the founding of the Paneuropean Union in 1923.]

These increasingly amalgamated bodies grew, with their legal successor the EU, both in size through the accessions of a further 22 states from 1973 to 2013, and in power through acquisitions of policy areas. In 2020, the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU; ten countries are aspiring or negotiating to join it.HistoryMain article: History of the European UnionFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of European Union history.Further information: Treaties of the European Union and European integrationAn Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreementsvteBackground: World Wars and aftermathFurther information: Ideas of European unity before 1948Internationalism and visions of European unity had existed since well before the 19th century, but gained particularly as a reaction to World War I and its aftermath. In this light the first advances for the idea of European integration were made. In 1920 John Maynard Keynes proposed a European customs union for the struggling post-war European economies,[20] and in 1923 the oldest organisation for European integration, the Paneuropean Union was founded, led by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who later would found in June 1947 the European Parliamentary Union (EPU).


=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: Early calls for European integration continued into the late 1920s, highlighted by French Prime Minister Aristide Briand's 1929 speech at the League of Nations advocating for a federal Europe to secure peace and settle Franco-German conflict. During World War II, the Allies established common goals through the 1941 Declaration of St James's Palace and the Atlantic Charter, which helped instigate new global institutions like the UN and the Bretton Woods System. Subsequent conferences, including Moscow, Tehran, and Yalta, increasingly focused on establishing joint post-war institutions for Europe, leading to the formation of the European Advisory Commission and later the Allied Control Council in 1945.]

Aristide Briand—who was Prime Minister of France, a follower of the Paneuropean Union, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for the Locarno Treaties—delivered a widely recognised speech at the League of Nations in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe and settle the historic Franco-German enmity.[21][22]With large-scale war being waged in Europe once again in the 1930s and becoming World War II, the question of what to fight against and what for had to be agreed on. A first agreement was the Declaration of St James's Palace of 1941, when Europe's resistance gathered in London. This was expanded on by the 1941 Atlantic Charter, establishing the Allies and their common goals, inciting a new wave of global international institutions like the United Nations (founded 1945) or the Bretton Woods System (1944).[23]In 1943 at the Moscow Conference and Tehran Conference, plans to establish joint institutions for a post-war world and Europe increasingly became a part of the agenda. This led to a decision at the Yalta Conference in 1944 to form a European Advisory Commission, later replaced by the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Allied Control Council, following the German surrender and the Potsdam Agreement in 1945.


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: Following World War II, European integration was viewed as a necessary defense against extreme nationalism, exemplified by Winston Churchill's 1946 speech advocating for a "European Union" and "Council of Europe." However, the focus quickly shifted toward security as the rigged 1947 Polish election revealed a growing rift between Western Allies and the Soviet Union. This led to key defensive measures in March 1947, including the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk between France and the UK, and the announcement of the Truman Doctrine pledging American support to counter Soviet expansion.]

By the end of the war, European integration became seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism that had caused the war.[24] On 19 September 1946, in a much recognised speech, Winston Churchill, speaking at the University of Zürich, reiterated his calls since 1930 for a "European Union" and "Council of Europe", coincidentally[25] parallel[clarification needed] to the Hertenstein Congress of the Union of European Federalists,[26] one of the then founded and later constituent members of the European Movement. One month later, the French Union was installed by the new Fourth French Republic to direct the decolonisation of its colonies so that they would become parts of a European community.[27]By 1947, a growing rift between the western Allied Powers and the Soviet Union became evident as a result of the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election, which constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement. March of that year saw two important developments. First was the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk between France and the United Kingdom. The treaty assured mutual assistance in the event of future military aggression against either nation. Though it officially named Germany as a threat, in reality the actual concern was for the Soviet Union. A few days later came the announcement of the Truman Doctrine which pledged American support for democracies to counter the Soviets.


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: The period starting in 1948 saw the institutionalized beginning of modern European integration, catalyzed by the February 1948 coup in Czechoslovakia, which led to the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and marked the start of the Cold War. Key organizational developments that year included the signing of the Treaty of Brussels, establishing the Western Union, and the foundation of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) to manage the Marshall Plan. This initial institutional push culminated in the pivotal Hague Congress of May 1948, which directly led to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949.]

The year 1948 marked the beginning of the institutionalised modern European integration. In March 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed, establishing the Western Union (WU), followed by the International Authority for the Ruhr. Furthermore, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the predecessor of the OECD, was also founded in 1948 to manage the Marshall Plan, which led to the Soviets creating Comecon in response. The ensuing Hague Congress of May 1948 was a pivotal moment in European integration, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe,[28] and most importantly to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949 (which is now Europe Day). The Council of Europe was one of the first institutions to bring the sovereign states of (then only Western) Europe together, raising great hopes and fevered debates in the following two years for further European integration.[citation needed]


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: The segment outlines the critical steps leading to the formation of early European institutions, starting with the achievement of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950. The foundation of the EU was cemented by the Schuman Declaration on May 9, 1950, which led six nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, and Italy) to draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty subsequently established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952, an organization designed to integrate vital industries to prevent future warfare and serving as the origin of institutions like the European Commission and Parliament.]

It has since been a broad forum to further cooperation and shared issues, achieving for example the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950.Essential for the actual birth of the institutions of the EU was the Schuman Declaration on 9 May 1950 (the day after the fifth Victory in Europe Day) and the decision by six nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, and Italy) to follow Schuman and draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty was created in 1952 the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was built on the International Authority for the Ruhr, installed by the Western Allies in 1949 to regulate the coal and steel industries of the Ruhr area in West Germany.[29] Backed by the Marshall Plan with large funds coming from the United States since 1948, the ECSC became a milestone organisation, enabling European economic development and integration and being the origin of the main institutions of the EU such as the European Commission and Parliament.[30]Founding fathers of the European Union understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, a future war between their nations became much less likely.[31]


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: This segment details early military and political integration efforts, noting the failure of the 1951 Pleven Plan to establish a European Political Community or Defence Community. Geopolitical shifts occurred when the Modified Brussels Treaty created the Western European Union (WEU) in 1954, followed by West Germany joining both the WEU and NATO in 1955, which prompted the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact. These events led to the 1955 Messina Conference, which commissioned the 1956 Spaak report to recommend further steps in European integration.]

In parallel with Schuman, the Pleven Plan of 1951 tried but failed to tie the institutions of the developing European community under the European Political Community, which was to include the also proposed European Defence Community, an alternative to West Germany joining NATO which was established in 1949 under the Truman Doctrine. In 1954 the Modified Brussels Treaty transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany eventually joined both the WEU and NATO in 1955, prompting the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact in 1955 as an institutional framework for its military domination in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Assessing the progress of European integration the Messina Conference was held in 1955, ordering the Spaak report, which in 1956 recommended the next significant steps of European integration.Treaty of Rome (1958‍–‍1972)Main article: History

[Summary: The period 1958-1972 began with the six founding nations (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and West Germany) signing the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom, both entering force in 1958. Despite tensions, particularly with France attempting to limit supranational power, the integration process continued. It culminated in the 1967 Merger Treaty, which unified the institutions of the three existing communities (ECSC, EEC, and Euratom) into a single framework known as the European Communities.]

Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Rome (1957), establishing the EEC
In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) and established a customs union. They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for cooperation in developing nuclear power. Both treaties came into force in 1958.[31] Although the EEC and Euratom were created separately from the ECSC, they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch (Hirsch Commission).[32][33]

The OEEC was in turn reformed in 1961 into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and its membership was extended to states outside of Europe, the United States and Canada. During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached, and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities.[34][35] Jean Rey presided over the first merged commission (Rey Commission).[36]

[Summary: The period between 1973 and 1993 saw significant enlargement of the European Communities, beginning with the inclusion of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom in 1973, followed by Greece (1981) and Portugal and Spain (1986). Key steps toward deeper integration included holding the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, signing the Schengen Agreement in 1985, and adopting the Single European Act in 1986.]

In 1973, the communities were enlarged to include Denmark (including Greenland), Ireland, and the United Kingdom.[37] Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum. The Ostpolitik and the ensuing détente led to establishment of a first truly pan-European body, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), predecessor of the modern Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held.[38] Greece joined in 1981. In 1985, Greenland left the Communities, following a dispute over fishing rights. During the same year, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states.[39] In 1986, the Single European Act was signed. Portugal and Spain joined in 1986.[40] In 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the communities as part of a reunified Germany.[41]

[Summary: The European Union (EU) was formally established on 1 November 1993, upon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty. The treaty, whose main architects included Horst Köhler, Helmut Kohl, and François Mitterrand, also formally renamed the European Economic Community (EEC) to the European Community. Furthermore, the Copenhagen criteria for prospective members were agreed upon in June 1993 in preparation for expanding the EU to include former communist states, Cyprus, and Malta.]

The European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty—whose main architects were Horst Köhler,[42] Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand—came into force on 1 November 1993.[19][43] The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred to as such before the treaty. With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.[44]

[Summary: The period between 1995 and 2004 saw major expansion and monetary integration for the EU. In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined, and in 2002, euro banknotes and coins were introduced in 12 member states, establishing the euro as the world's second-largest reserve currency. The year 2004 marked the EU's biggest enlargement to date, incorporating ten new countries.]

In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU. In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the eurozone has increased to encompass 20 countries. The euro currency became the second-largest reserve currency in the world. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the union.[45]

[Summary: Between 2007 and 2013, the EU continued to expand, with Bulgaria and Romania joining in 2007 and Croatia becoming the 28th member in 2013. This period was defined by institutional reform, primarily through the Lisbon Treaty (2009), which merged the three pillars system, created a permanent president of the European Council (Herman Van Rompuy), and strengthened the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012.]

In 2007, Bulgaria and Romania became EU members. Later that year, Slovenia adopted the euro,[45] followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, Lithuania in 2015, and Croatia in 2023. On 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the EU, merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality, created a permanent president of the European Council, the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy, and strengthened the position of the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy.[46][47]

In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for having "contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy, and human rights in Europe".[48][49] In 2013, Croatia became the 28th EU member.[50]


=== SEGMENT 14 ===
[Summary: Beginning in the 2010s, the European Union faced significant challenges to its cohesion, including the eurozone debt crisis, the 2015 asylum seekers surge, and the United Kingdom's formal withdrawal on January 31, 2020. The early 2020s saw internal changes like Croatia adopting the euro and the unprecedented creation of common EU debt to fund the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery program following the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the EU responded decisively to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 by imposing heavy sanctions and providing pooled military aid.]

From the beginning of the 2010s, the cohesion of the European Union has been tested by several issues, including a debt crisis in some of the eurozone countries, a surge in asylum seekers in 2015, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.[51] A referendum in the UK on its membership of the European Union was held in 2016, with 51.9 per cent of participants voting to leave.[52] The UK formally notified the European Council of its decision to leave on 29 March 2017, initiating the formal withdrawal procedure for leaving the EU; following extensions to the process, the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, although most areas of EU law continued to apply to the UK for a transition period which lasted until 31 December 2020.[53]

The early 2020s saw Denmark abolishing one of its three opt-outs and Croatia adopting the euro. After the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU leaders agreed for the first time to create common debt to finance the European Recovery Program called Next Generation EU (NGEU).[54] On 24 February 2022, after massing on the borders of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces undertook an attempt for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[55][56] The European Union imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and agreed on a pooled military aid package to Ukraine for lethal weapons funded via the European Peace Facility off-budget instrument.[57]

[Summary: The text details the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery package, established to help EU member states recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, valued at €750 billion and operating from 2021 to 2026. Beyond recovery, the EU is prioritizing preparation for a major enlargement, aiming to reach 35 member states by 2030, requiring significant institutional and budgetary reforms. Furthermore, the segment notes concerns that the war in Ukraine and subsequent inflation might influence the June 2024 elections, potentially undermining existing EU policies.]

The ancient Roman Agora in Athens illuminated with a Next Generation EU sign
NGEU is a European Commission economic recovery package to support the EU member states to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular those that have been particularly hard hit. It is sometimes styled NextGenerationEU and Next Gen EU, and also called the European Union Recovery Instrument.[58] Agreed in principle by the European Council on 21 July 2020 and adopted on 14 December 2020, the instrument is worth €750 billion. NGEU will operate from 2021 to 2026,[59] and will be tied to the regular 2021–2027 budget of the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The comprehensive NGEU and MFF packages are projected to reach €1824.3 billion.[60]

Preparing the EU for a new great enlargement is one of its political priorities, with the goal of achieving 35 member states by 2030. Institutional and budgetary reforms are being discussed in order for the EU to be ready for the new members.[61][62][63][64] In May 2024, concerns rise, that the outcome of the elections in June, can undermine some of the crucial policies of the EU in the domain of environment, diplomacy, and economy. The war in Ukraine by creating inflation, lowering life level created a possibility of strong changes in the 2024 elections.[65][66]

Timeline
Since the end of World War II, most sovereign European countries have entered into treaties and thereby co-operated and harmonised policies (or pooled sovereignty) in an increasing number of areas, in the European integration project or the construction of Europe (French: la construction européenne). The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)—the principal framework for this unification. The EU inherited many of its present organizations, institutions, and responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration.

[Summary: This segment first lists the signing and entry into force dates for several key European Union treaties, including the Single European Act, Schengen agreements, Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice, and Lisbon Treaties. It then describes the political framework of the European Union, which operates using a hybrid of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making. This operation is strictly governed by the principles of conferral (acting only within treaty-defined competences) and subsidiarity (acting only when member states cannot sufficiently achieve an objective alone).]

=== SEGMENT 19 ===
[Summary: EU legal instruments are primarily regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states, and directives, which require national implementation in domestic legislation. The segment also describes the growth of the EU from the six founding states of the EEC to 27 members, noting that accession requires countries to delegate partial sovereignty, a practice termed "pooling of sovereignty," in exchange for representation.]

Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms.[69] Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).[g] EU policy is in general promulgated by EU directives, which are then implemented in the domestic legislation of its member states, and EU regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states. Lobbying at the EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process.[70]Member statesMain article: Member state of the European UnionMap showing the member states of the European Union (clickable)Through successive enlargements, the EU and its predecessors have grown from the six founding states of the EEC to 27 members. Countries accede to the union by becoming a party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".[71][72]

[Summary: EU member states often form strategic alliances internally, citing examples like the Visegrád Group and the Benelux Union. To join the EU, prospective members must satisfy the Copenhagen criteria, established in 1993, which mandate a stable democracy, adherence to human rights and the rule of law, and a functioning market economy. The European Council is tasked with evaluating a country's fulfillment of these criteria.]

In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the union. Examples of such alliances include the Baltic Assembly, the Benelux Union, the Bucharest Nine, the Craiova Group, the EU Med Group, the Lublin Triangle, the New Hanseatic League, the Three Seas Initiative, the Visegrád Group, and the Weimar Triangle.To become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.[73]

Additionally, it details the internal standardization mechanism used for member-state subdivisions, the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), which is a geocode standard adopted in 2003 for statistical purposes and is crucial for the delivery of EU funds.]

The four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.[74][75] The relationships of the European microstates Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.[76]List of member states in the European Union SubdivisionsMain article: Nomenclature of Territorial Units for StatisticsSubdivisions of member-states are based on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), a geocode standard for statistical purposes. The standard, adopted in 2003, is developed and regulated by the European Union, and thus only covers the member states of the EU in detail. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics is instrumental in the European Union's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund delivery mechanisms and for locating the area where goods and services subject to European public procurement legislation are to be delivered.

[Summary: The governance structure of the EU operates on the principle that member states retain all powers unless they have collectively agreed to delegate them to the Union, though the exact limits of this delegation are sometimes disputed. The distribution of legislative competence is structured into three main categories: exclusive competence, shared competence, and supporting competence. In areas of shared competence, member states can only legislate if the EU has not, while in supporting areas, the EU can only coordinate and supplement member state action without enacting harmonizing legislation.]

GovernanceMain articles: Bodies of the European Union and the Euratom, Institutions of the European Union, and Subsidiarity (European Union) § EU competencesMember states retain in principle all powers except those that they have agreed collectively to delegate to the Union as a whole, though the exact delimitation has on occasions become a subject of scholarly or legal disputes.[86][87] In certain fields, members have awarded exclusive competence and exclusive mandate to the Union. These are areas in which member states have entirely renounced their own capacity to enact legislation. In other areas, the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, the member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas, the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.[88] That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area. The distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided into the following three categories:


=== SEGMENT 24 ===
[Summary: The text details the three categories of legislative powers shared between the European Union and its member states: Exclusive, Shared, and Supporting competence. Exclusive competence grants the EU sole authority in fields like the customs union and Eurozone monetary policy. Shared competence applies to broad areas such as the internal market and environment, where member states can only legislate if the EU has not, while Supporting competence allows the EU merely to coordinate or supplement member state actions in fields like research, culture, and public health.]

The European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its institutions: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.Branches of powerMain article: Bodies of the European Union and the EuratomExecutive branchMain articles: European Council and European CommissionPortrait of António CostaAntónio Costa,President of the European CouncilPortrait of Ursula von der LeyenUrsula von der Leyen,President of the European CommissionThe Union's executive branch is organised as a directorial system, where the executive power is jointly exercised by several people.

The high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy (presently Kaja Kallas) also takes part in its meetings. Described by some as the union's "supreme political leadership",[90] it is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies. Its leadership role involves solving disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolving any political crises or disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts as a "collective head of state" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).[91] Tasks for the president of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU,[92] driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU and based in Strasbourg.

The European Commission acts both as the EU's executive arm, responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, and also the legislative initiator, with the sole power to propose laws for debate.[93][94][95] The commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.[96] It has 27 European commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. The leader of the 27 is the president of the European Commission (presently Ursula von der Leyen for 2019–2024, reelected for the 2024–2029 term), proposed by the European Council, following and taking into account the result of the European elections, and is then elected by the European Parliament.[97]

The hierarchy places the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy as the most prominent commissioner after the President, also serving ex-officio as a Vice-President and chosen by the European Council. While member states nominate all candidates, the final appointment of the 27 commissioners involves the Council of the European Union and the nominated President, followed by a collective approval vote by the European Parliament.]

The President retains, as the leader responsible for the entire cabinet, the final say in accepting or rejecting a candidate submitted for a given portfolio by a member state, and oversees the commission's permanent civil service. After the President, the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy, who is ex-officio a vice-president of the European Commission and is also chosen by the European Council.[98] The other 25 commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated president. The 27 commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by a vote of the European Parliament. All commissioners are first nominated by the government of the respective member state.[99]

It consists of a representative from each member state's government and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body. In addition to the legislative functions, members of the council also have executive responsibilities, such as the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and the coordination of broad economic policies within the Union.[103] The Presidency of the council rotates between member states, with each holding it for six months.

[Summary: The European Parliament is a key legislative institution of the EU, comprising 705 members (MEPs) who are directly elected every five years and sit according to political groups. It works jointly with the Council of the European Union to approve legislation proposed by the European Commission, including the EU budget. The Parliament also has the power to approve or reject the proposed membership of the Commission, and its own president and vice-presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.]

The European Parliament is one of three legislative institutions of the EU, which together with the Council of the European Union is tasked with amending and approving the European Commission's proposals. 705 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation. MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.[104] In the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Commission proposes legislation, which requires the joint approval of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pass. This process applies to nearly all areas, including the EU budget. The parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the Court of Justice. The president of the European Parliament carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally. The president and vice-presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.[105]

Established in Luxembourg in 1952, the CJEU acts as the supreme court for EU law, interpreting it and ensuring its uniform application across all member states. Its case-law dictates the supremacy of EU law over any inconsistent national law.]

Judicial branchMain article: Court of Justice of the European UnionPortrait of Koen LenaertsKoen Lenaerts,President of the Court of JusticeThe judicial branch of the European Union is formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and consists of two courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court.[106] The Court of Justice is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the CJEU, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its uniform application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court was established in 1952, and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state – currently 27 – although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or fifteen judges. The Court has been led by president Koen Lenaerts since 2015. The CJEU is the highest court of the European Union in matters of Union law. Its case-law provides that EU law has supremacy over any national law that is inconsistent with EU law.[107]


=== SEGMENT 32 ===
[Summary: The CJEU does not accept appeals against national court decisions; instead, national courts utilize the 'preliminary reference' mechanism to obtain interpretations of EU law, which they then apply locally. This system, mandatory for courts of final appeal, grants the CJEU the power to ensure the consistent application of EU law across the Union. Additionally, the CJEU functions as an administrative and constitutional court capable of annulling unlawful acts committed by EU institutions and bodies.]

It is not possible to appeal against the decisions of national courts in the CJEU, but rather national courts refer questions of EU law to the CJEU (a preliminary reference). However, it is ultimately for the national court to apply the resulting interpretation (the preliminary ruling) to the facts of any given case. Although, only courts of final appeal are bound to refer a question of EU law when one is addressed. The treaties give the CJEU the power for consistent application of EU law across the EU as a whole. The court also acts as an administrative and constitutional court between the other EU institutions and the Member States and can annul or invalidate unlawful acts of EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.

[Summary: The General Court is a constituent court of the European Union that primarily handles actions brought by individuals and member states against EU institutions, with appeals to the Court of Justice limited strictly to points of law. Formerly known as the Court of First Instance before the Lisbon Treaty, the General Court has recently seen an expansion of its responsibilities. Since amendments in October 2024, it now shares jurisdiction with the Court of Justice over preliminary references in six specific areas, including VAT, customs duties, and passenger compensation schemes.]

The General Court is a constituent court of the European Union. It hears actions taken against the institutions of the European Union by individuals and member states, although certain matters are reserved for the Court of Justice. Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a point of law. Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance. Since the amendments to the Statute of the CJEU in October 2024, the Court of Justice shares its jurisdiction over references for a preliminary ruling with the General Court.[108] The General Court is since then competent to handle preliminary references falling under one of the six following areas: the common system of value added tax; excise duties; the Customs Code; the tariff classification of goods under the Combined Nomenclature; compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding or delay or cancellation of transport services; the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.[109]

The EU had a long-term budget of €1,082.5 billion for the period 2014–2020, representing 1.02% of the EU-28's GNI. In 1960, the budget of the European Community was 0.03 per cent of GDP.[111] Of this, €54bn subsidised agriculture enterprise, €42bn was spent on transport, building and the environment, €16bn on education and research, €13bn on welfare, €20bn on foreign and defence policy, €2bn in finance, €2bn in energy, €1.5bn in communications, and €13bn in administration. In November 2020, two members of the union, Hungary and Poland, blocked approval to the EU's budget at a meeting in the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper), citing a proposal that linked funding with adherence to the rule of law. The budget included a COVID-19 recovery fund of €750 billion.[112][113] The budget was finally approved by 12 December when Hungary and Poland withdrew their vetoes after further negotiations in the council and the European Council.[114]

[Summary: To protect its finances, the EU established bodies like the European Anti-fraud Office and the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), which specifically investigates fraud against the EU budget, including cases exceeding thresholds like €10,000 for EU funds fraud. Constitutionally, the EU is defined by the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, resembling both a confederation and a federation but formally defining itself as neither. Its extensive use of qualified majority voting makes it more integrated than a traditional confederation.]

Bodies combatting fraud have also been established, including the European Anti-fraud Office and the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The latter is a decentralised independent body of the European Union (EU), established under the Treaty of Lisbon between 22 of the 27 states of the EU following the method of enhanced cooperation.[115] The European Public Prosecutor's Office investigate and prosecute fraud against the budget of the European Union and other crimes against the EU's financial interests including fraud concerning EU funds of over €10,000 and cross-border VAT fraud cases involving damages above €10 million.

(It does not have a formal constitution: its status is defined by the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). It is more integrated than a traditional confederation of states because the general level of government widely employs qualified majority voting in some decision-making among the member states, rather than relying exclusively on unanimity.[118][119]

[Summary: The EU is less integrated than a federal state because sovereignty fundamentally rests with the member states, who retain control over critical areas such as taxation, use of armed force, and the right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50. However, the EU also operates under the principle of supremacy, a doctrine developed by the Court of Justice in the 1960s, which mandates that national courts enforce ratified EU treaties even when they conflict with domestic or constitutional law.]

The EU is less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several peoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single undifferentiated whole. This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called Kompetenz-kompetenz); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of subsidiarity requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined. Under the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.[i] The direct effect and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman Robert Lecourt.[120] The question whether the secondary law enacted by the EU has a comparable status in relation to national legislation, has been a matter of debate among legal scholars.


=== SEGMENT 40 ===
[Summary: The European Union's legal framework is built upon Primary Law, consisting of treaties that establish the EU, grant it legal personality, and empower its institutions to achieve broad policy goals. Secondary Law, which includes regulations, directives, and decisions, forms the main body of EU legal acts, all of which are of equal legal value. Regulations are immediately binding across all member states, while directives mandate results but leave implementation methods to member states, and decisions apply only to specified entities.]

Primary law The European Union is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.[121] These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation[j] which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.[k] The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.[122] Secondary law The main legal acts of the European Union come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,[l] and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.[j] Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.[m] When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states. Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.[123]

[Summary: EU foreign policy cooperation originated in 1957 through member states negotiating international trade as a bloc, later expanding coordination through the European Political Cooperation (EPC) starting in 1970. The EPC was formalized in 1987 and subsequently renamed the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty. The CFSP promotes EU interests and international goals like democracy and human rights, but its effectiveness is constrained by the requirement for unanimity among member states on policy issues.]

Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of the European Union See also: European External Action Service Portrait of Kaja Kallas Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the EU's common commercial policy.[124] Steps for more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.[125] The stated aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.[126] The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq.[127]


=== SEGMENT 42 ===
[Summary: The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is coordinated by the High Representative, who speaks for the EU on foreign policy and defense matters and heads the European External Action Service (EEAS), the EU's diplomatic corps operational since December 2010. Additionally, the EU exerts international influence through its enlargement policy, which incentivizes political and economic reform in states wishing to meet accession criteria. This non-military influence on the internal affairs of other countries is commonly referred to as "soft power," contrasting with military "hard power."]

The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The high representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department[128] that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.[129] The EEAS serves as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union.[130] Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.[131]:	762	This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as "soft power", as opposed to military "hard power".[132] Humanitarian aid Further information: Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations The European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, or

[Summary: The European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, known as ECHO, provides EU humanitarian aid to developing countries, utilizing a 2012 budget of €874 million, with 51% allocated to Africa. This humanitarian aid is financed primarily by the EU budget (70%) and supplemented by the European Development Fund (30%). The EU's broader external action financing is structured into geographic and thematic instruments, including the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), which requires 95% of its funding to be spent on official development assistance (ODA).]

"ECHO", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2012, its budget amounted to €874 million, 51 per cent of the budget went to Africa and 20 per cent to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20 per cent to the Middle East and Mediterranean.[133] Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70 per cent) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30 per cent).[134] The EU's external action financing is divided into geographic instruments and thematic instruments.[134] The geographic instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95 per cent of its budget on official development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes.[134]

The EU offers financial assistance to these countries, many of which are developing nations aspiring to closer integration or eventual membership, provided they meet strict conditions regarding government and economic reforms. This cooperation is typically formalized through an Action Plan agreed upon by Brussels and the target country.]

The European Union uses foreign relations instruments like the European Neighbourhood Policy which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union, or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.

EU development action is formally based on the European Consensus on Development, endorsed in 2005, and utilizes funding mechanisms such as the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance and the Global Europe programmes, often implemented through bilateral partnership agreements.]

Union for the Mediterranean meeting in Barcelona
There is also the worldwide European Union Global Strategy. International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily. Its role was recognised in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa; and the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements are the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognise that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas – people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership – in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity.

EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the council, the European Parliament and the commission.[137] It is applied from the principles of Capability approach and Rights-based approach to development. Funding is provided by the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance and the Global Europe programmes. Partnership and cooperation agreements are bilateral agreements with non-member nations.[138]

The predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes.[139] In 2025, Europe initiated the ReArm program, a strategic breakthrough aimed at mobilising local industrial capabilities and bolstering European equipment production, involves a financial investment of €800 billion to support the development and procurement, simultaneously enhancing the continent's overall military readiness and self-sufficiency.[140][141][142]

Twenty-three EU members are members of NATO while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.[143] The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, closed in 2011[144] as its role had been transferred to the EU.[145]

The segment also highlights the nuclear status of EU members: France is the sole recognized nuclear weapon state and permanent UNSC member, while Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium participate in NATO nuclear sharing.]

Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel.[146] The EU Strategic Compass adopted in 2022 reaffirmed the bloc's partnership with NATO, committed to increased military mobility and formation of a 5,000-strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity[147]

Since the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, France is the only member officially recognised as a nuclear weapon state and the sole holder of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. France and Italy are also the only EU countries that have power projection capabilities outside of Europe.[148] Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium participate in NATO nuclear sharing.[149] Most EU member states opposed the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty.[150]

EU forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern Africa to the western Balkans and western Asia.[151] EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff.[152] The European Union Military Staff is the highest military institution of the European Union, established within the framework of the European Council, and follows on from the decisions of the Helsinki European Council (10–11 December 1999), which called for the establishment of permanent political-military institutions. The European Union Military Staff is under the authority of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Political and Security Committee. It directs all military activities in the EU context, including planning and conducting military missions and operations in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy and the development of military capabilities, and provides the Political and Security Committee with military advice and recommendations on military issues. In an EU consisting of 27 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states.[153]

To facilitate police and immigration cooperation, the EU also operates several common databases, including the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), the Entry/Exit System (EES), and the Schengen Information System (SIS). These security measures were implemented largely in response to the challenges of cross-border crime associated with the open borders of the Schengen Area.]

The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) is an agency of the EU aiming to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration.[154] The EU also operates the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, the Entry/Exit System, the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and the Common European Asylum System which provide common databases for police and immigration authorities. The impetus for the development of this co-operation was the advent of open borders in the Schengen Area and the associated cross-border crime.[18]

The EU's member states cover an area of 4,233,262 square kilometres (1,634,472 sq mi),[n] and therefore a large part of the European continent. The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps, 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft) above sea level.[155] The lowest points in the EU are Lammefjorden, Denmark, and Zuidplaspolder, Netherlands, at 7 m (23 ft) below sea level.[156] The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006 mi) long. In addition to national territories in Europe, there are 32 special territories of members of the European Economic Area, not all of which are part of the EU. The largest by area is Greenland, which is not part of the EU but whose citizens are EU citizens, while the largest by population are the Canary Islands off Africa, which are part of the EU and the Schengen area. French Guiana in South America is part of the EU and the eurozone, as is Mayotte, north of Madagascar.

In 1957, when the European Economic Community was founded, it had no environmental policy.[158] Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards, and biotechnology.[158] According to the Institute for European Environmental Policy, environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics.[159]

European policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem.[158] Trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state.[160] In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.[159]

[Summary: The EU's environmental policy has expanded from a Europe-focused approach to demonstrating global leadership, notably by supporting international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol, a role strengthened by the Lisbon Treaty. A top priority is climate change mitigation, with 2007 targets requiring 20% renewable energy use and a minimum 20% reduction in CO2 emissions below 1990 levels by 2020. The EU claims its greenhouse gas emissions were 23% lower in 2018 than in 1990.]

Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,[161] which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.[158] EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.[159]

Mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20 per cent of the energy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels.[162] In 2017, the EU emitted 9.1 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions.[163] The European Union claims that already in 2018, its GHG emissions were 23% lower than in 1990.[164]

[Summary: The EU has implemented several key climate policies, including an emissions trading system and the European Green Capital award, while also seeing increased political support for environmental action following the 2019 European Parliament elections. Major legislative milestones include the June 2021 European Climate Law, which mandates a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, despite initial resistance to the 2050 goal from four member states. Furthermore, the EU is strengthening international cooperation, having pledged with the US to cut methane emissions and joining the Global carbon market coalition in 2025.]

The EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy.[165] The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city. In the 2019 elections to the European Parliament, the green parties increased their power, possibly because of the rise of post materialist values.[166] Proposals to reach a zero carbon economy in the European Union by 2050 were suggested in 2018–2019. Almost all member states supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland disagreed.[167] In June 2021, the European Union passed a European Climate Law with targets of 55% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.[168] Also in the same year, the European Union and the United States pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The pledge is considered as a big achievement for climate change mitigation.[169] A research report from November 2024 declared that the Czech Republic is the EU's most toxic country in Europe for care emissions.[170]

In 2025, The European Union together with China, Brazil and others, joined the Global carbon market coalition.[171] According to some calculations, a global carbon market can speed up emission reduction seven-fold.[172]

The gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of economic activity, of EU member states was US$16.64 trillion in 2022, around 16.6 per cent of the world GDP.[173] There is a significant variation in GDP per capita between and within individual EU states. The difference between the richest and poorest regions (281 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2017, from 31 per cent (Severozapaden, Bulgaria) of the EU28 average (€30,000) to 253 per cent (Luxembourg), or from €4,600 to €92,600.[174]

EU member states own the estimated third largest after the United States (US$140 trillion) and China (US$84 trillion) net wealth in the world, equal to around one sixth (US$76 trillion) of the US$454 trillion global wealth.[175] Of the top 500 largest corporations in the world measured by revenue in 2024, 90 had their headquarters in the EU.[176] In 2016, unemployment in the EU stood at 8.9 per cent[177] while inflation was at 2.2 per cent, and the account balance at −0.9 per cent of GDP.

[Summary: The euro is the official currency for 20 EU member states, a goal officially set by the European Economic Community in 1969. The foundation for the currency union was established when member states signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, legally obligating aspiring members to meet strict convergence criteria. These requirements include prior participation in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, demonstrating budgetary discipline, and limiting government deficits and debt as outlined in the European Fiscal Pact.]

The euro is the official currency in 20 member states of the EU. The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union. The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level, as agreed in the European Fiscal Pact.

Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.[179] Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.

The European System of Financial Supervision is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the central bank.

In 1999, the currency union started to materialise through introducing a common accounting (virtual) currency in eleven of the member states. In 2002, it was turned into a fully-fledged conventible currency, when euro notes and coins were issued, while the phaseout of national currencies in the eurozone (consisting by then of 12 member states) was initiated. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 20 countries.[181][182]

The 20 EU member states known collectively as the eurozone have fully implemented the currency union by superseding their national currencies with the euro.

Competition and consumer protectionMain articles: European Union competition law and European consumer lawSee also: European Union Intellectual Property OfficeThe EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.[o] In 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (General Electric and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority.[192] Another high-profile case, against Microsoft, resulted in the commission fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action.[193]External tradeMain article: Common Commercial Policy (EU)EU free trade agreements  European Union  Agreement in force  Agreement (in part) provisionally appliedThe European Union has concluded free trade agreements (FTAs)[194] and other agreements with a trade component with many countries worldwide and is negotiating with many others.[195] The European Union's services trade surplus rose from $16 billion in 2000 to more than $250 billion in 2018.[196] In 2020, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China became the EU's largest trading partner, displacing the United States.[197] The European Union is the largest exporter in the world[198] and in 2008 was the largest importer of goods and services.[199][200] Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as tariffs and border controls. In the eurozone, trade is helped by not having any currency differences to deal with amongst most members.[191] Externally, the EU's free-trade agreement with Japan is perhaps its most notable one. The EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement was officially signed on 17 July 2018, becoming the world's largest bilateral free trade deal when it went into effect on 1 February 2019, creating an open trade zone covering nearly one-third of global GDP.[201][202]

[Summary: The EU's total energy supply in 2019 was 59 billion GJ (10.2% of the world total), with approximately three-fifths sourced from imports, mainly fossil fuels. While oil (31.7%) and natural gas (24.7%) dominated the supply mix, renewable energy contributed 18.1% of the total supply that year. The EU has a long history of energy policy dating back to the European Coal and Steel Community, and formally approved a mandatory, comprehensive European energy policy in October 2005.]

Approximately three fifths of the energy available in the EU came from imports (mostly of fossil fuels). Renewable energy contributed 18.1 per cent of the EU's total energy supply in 2019, and 11.1 per cent of the final energy consumption.[204] The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.[205]

[Summary: The EU's energy policy is structured around five key points, including increasing market competition, diversifying resources, and boosting efficiency and renewable energy commercialization. Due to high dependence on imported fossil fuels, especially Russian natural gas, the EU responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in May 2022 by preparing sanctions targeting Russian oil imports. Simultaneously, the European Commission launched the €300 billion RePowerEU initiative to eliminate dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2030 and accelerate the clean energy transition.]

Energy CommunityThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia[206] and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.[205]In 2007, EU countries as a whole imported 82 per cent of their oil, 57 per cent of their natural gas[207] and 97.48 per cent of their uranium[208] demands. The three largest suppliers of natural gas to the European Union are Russia, Norway and Algeria, that amounted for about three quarters of the imports in 2019.[209] There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been attempting to reduce.[210]In May 2022, it was reported that the European Union was preparing another sanction against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. It is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks, as well as individuals and companies. According to an article by Reuters, two diplomats stated that the European Union may impose a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022.[211] Also in May 2022, the European Commission published the RePowerEU initiative, a €300 billion plan outlining the path towards the end of EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2030 and the acceleration on the clean energy transition.[212]

[Summary: The European Union manages its cross-border transport infrastructure, including road, rail, airport, and water systems, through the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), established in 1990. TEN-T is structured into a Core Network slated for completion by 2030 and a Comprehensive Network due by 2050, currently encompassing 9 core corridors. Key components include the Trans-European road network and maritime operations, where the Port of Rotterdam serves as the EU's busiest seaport, with regulatory oversight provided by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA).]

The segment concludes by noting that rail transportation is organized under TEN-T via high-speed and conventional rail networks.]

Air transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Airport network. European airports are categorised as international, community, or regional. The Charles de Gaulle Airport is the busiest in the EU, located in and near the city of Paris, in France.[216] The European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) is a single market in aviation. ECAA agreements were signed on 5 May 2006 in Salzburg, Austria between the EU and some third countries. The ECAA liberalises the air transport industry by allowing any company from any ECAA member state to fly between any ECAA member states airports, thereby allowing a "foreign" airline to provide domestic flights. The Single European Sky (SES) is an initiative that seeks to reform the European air traffic management system through a series of actions carried out in four different levels (institutional, operational, technological and control and supervision) with the aim of satisfying the needs of the European airspace in terms of capacity, safety, efficiency and environmental impact. Civil aviation safety is under the responsibility of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It carries out certification, regulation and standardisation and also performs investigation and monitoring. The idea of a European-level aviation safety authority goes back to 1996, but the agency was only legally established in 2002, and began operating in 2003.Rail transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Rail network, made up of the high-speed rail n

Being an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice policy of the EU, it mostly functions as a single jurisdiction under a common visa policy for international travel purposes. The area is named after the 1985 Schengen Agreement and the 1990 Schengen Convention, both signed in Schengen, Luxembourg. Of the 27 EU member states, 25 participate in the Schengen Area. Of the EU members that are not part of the Schengen Area, one—Cyprus—is legally obligated to join the area in the future; Ireland maintains an opt-out, and instead operates its own visa policy. The four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, are not members of the EU, but have signed agreements in association with the Schengen Agreement. Also, three European microstates – Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City – maintain open borders for passenger traffic with their neighbours, and are therefore considered de facto members of the Schengen Area due to the practical impossibility of travelling to or from them without transiting through at least one Schengen member country.

This was the first common political framework for space activities established by the EU. Each member state has pursued to some extent their own national space policy, though often co-ordinating through the ESA. Günter Verheugen, the European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, has stated that even though the EU is "a world leader in the technology", it was "being put on the defensive by the United States and Russia and that it only has about a 10-year technological advantage on China and India, which are racing to catch up".

[Summary: The European Union manages several major space initiatives, including the Galileo Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which went live in 2016. The €10 billion Galileo project provides an independent, high-precision positioning system, intended to reduce European reliance on US GPS or Russian GLONASS systems. Furthermore, the EU operates the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and the Copernicus Programme, the latter being the EU's extensive Earth observation initiative focused on environmental management and civil security.]

Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that went live in 2016, created by the EU through the ESA, operated by the EUSPA, with two ground operations centres in Fucino, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The €10 billion project is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European political and military authorities do not have to rely on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) developed by the ESA and EUROCONTROL. Currently, it supplements the GPS by reporting on the reliability and accuracy of their positioning data and sending out corrections. The system will supplement Galileo in a future version. The Copernicus Programme is the EU's Earth observation programme coordinated and managed by EUSPA in partnership with ESA. It aims at achieving a global, continuous, autonomous, high quality, wide range Earth observation capacity, providing accurate, timely and easily accessible information to, among other things, improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, and ensure civil security.

The CAP, introduced in 1962, uses subsidies and has seen its budget share decrease significantly, though it remains criticized for its cost and environmental effects. The CFP, established in 2009 by the Treaty of Lisbon, sets fishing quotas and subsidies, and is recognized as an exclusive competence of the EU.]

Agriculture and fisheriesMain articles: Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries PolicySee also: European Fisheries Control Agency and European Food Safety AuthorityThe EU's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). At 25 million square kilometres, it is the largest in the world.[219]The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has since then undergone several changes to reduce the EEC budget cost (from 73% in 1985 to 37% in 2017) and consider rural development in its aims. It has, however, been criticised on the grounds of its cost and its environmental and humanitarian effects.Likewise, the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union. It sets quotas for which member states are allowed to catch each type of fish, as well as encouraging the fishing industry by various market interventions and fishing subsidies. It was introduced in 2009 with the Treaty of Lisbon, which formally enshrined fisheries conservation policy as one of the handful of "exclusive competences" reserved for the European Union.

[Summary: The EU's labor policy is centered on the free movement of persons, allowing citizens to live and work freely across member states, requiring the recognition of professional qualifications. The EU also seeks to protect workers' rights and prevent social dumping by adopting laws establishing minimum employment standards, such as the Working Time Directive and the Minimum Wage Directive approved in September 2022. Unemployment rates show wide variation, with the EU average at 6.7% in September 2018, contrasted with lows like 2.3% in the Czech Republic and highs like 10.61% in Spain (2024).]

LabourSee also: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, European Labour Authority, European Training Foundation, and EURESThe free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.[220] The EU seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent in September 2018.[221] The euro area unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent.[221] Among the member states, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3 per cent), Germany and Poland (both 3.4 per cent), and the highest in Spain (10.61 per cent in 2024)[222] and Greece (9.6 per cent in November 2024).[223] The European Union has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting workers' rights and preventing social and environmental dumping.[citation needed] To this end, it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the Working Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The European Directive about Minimum Wage, which looks to lift minimum wages and strengthen collective bargaining was approved by the European Parliament in September 2022.[224]

The EU has no formal connection to any religion. Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union[246] recognises the "status under national law of churches and religious associations" as well as that of "philosophical and non-confessional organisations".[247] The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe".[247][248] Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or a god, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.[249]

Christians in the EU include Catholics of both Roman and Eastern Rite, numerous Protestant denominations with Lutherans, Anglicans, and Reformed forming the majority of Protestant affiliations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million,[250] and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.[251] The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population. Eurostat's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52 per cent of EU citizens believed in a god, 27 per cent in "some sort of spirit or life force", and 18 per cent had no form of belief.[252]

[Summary: The segment first details religious trends in the EU, noting general declines in church attendance across many countries, but highlighting significant variation: Estonia and the Czech Republic reported the lowest religious belief (16% and 19%), while Malta (95%), Cyprus, and Romania (~90%) were the most religious. It then shifts focus to education, explaining that while the EU's role in basic education is limited to supporting national governments, its involvement in higher education is significant through mobility programs like the Erasmus Programme, which began in 1987 and supported over 1.5 million students in its first two decades.]

Into the 21st century, many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership.[253] The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16 per cent) and the Czech Republic (19 per cent).[252] The most religious countries were Malta (95 per cent, predominantly Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90 per cent of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16, and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale".[252]

Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Renaissance humanist after whom the Erasmus Programme is named
Basic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years, it supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and became a symbol of European student life.[254]


=== SEGMENT 83 ===
[Summary: The EU supports educational mobility and knowledge sharing through programs like the Lifelong Learning Programme (2007–2013), which targets school pupils, teachers, and adult learners, while also promoting the standardization of degrees through the Bologna Process. Furthermore, the EU facilitates scientific development via Framework Programmes, first established in 1984, which aim to coordinate research and address specific areas like developing renewable energy to reduce dependence on imported fuels.]

There are similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.[255][256] Through its support of the Bologna Process, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe. Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.[257] EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.[258]

[Summary: The EU places high importance on health protection, which is mandated by Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be ensured across all Union policies and activities. The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers works to align national laws concerning public health, consumer rights, and the safety of food and other products. Furthermore, citizens of EU and many other European countries are provided with a free European Health Insurance Card, which offers reciprocal insurance for emergency medical treatment while traveling.]

Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that "A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities". The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.[259][260][261]

All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.[262] A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation

[Summary: A directive promotes cooperation on healthcare between EU member states, focusing on facilitating safe and high-quality cross-border treatment for European patients. The EU maintains a high life expectancy, reaching 80.1 years at birth in 2021, which is approximately nine years higher than the world average. Regionally, life expectancy is generally lower in Eastern Europe compared to Western Europe, with Madrid, Spain, holding the highest regional life expectancy in the EU in 2018 at 85.2 years.]

=== SEGMENT 86 ===
[Summary: The EU works to coordinate member states' social security and health systems to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and maintain access to services. The EU has also strengthened its focus on equality and social rights, notably by having a European Commissioner for equality since 2019 and adopting the first EU Strategy on LGBTIQ equality in 2020. Recent initiatives include the approval of a European Care strategy in September 2022 and proposals for directives countering gender-based violence and codifying a union-wide law against LGBT hate crimes.]

Social rights and equalityMain articles: European social model, European Social Fund Plus, Welfare State, European Social Charter, European Voluntary Service, European labour law, List of countries by guaranteed minimum income, European Pillar of Social Rights, and List of European Union member states by minimum wageThe EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states. Since 2019 there has been a European commissioner for equality and the European Institute for Gender Equality has existed since 2007. A Directive on countering gender-based violence has been proposed.[268][269] In September 2022, a European Care strategy was approved in order to provide "quality, affordable and accessible care services".[270] The European Social Charter is the main body that recognises the social rights of European citizens. In 2020, the first ever European Union Strategy on LGBTIQ equality was approved under Helena Dalli mandate.[271] In December 2021, the commission announced the intention of codifying a union-wide law against LGBT hate crimes.[272]

[Summary: The Area of freedom, security and justice is anchored by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which grants EU citizens a wide range of political, social, and economic rights. Since the EU's creation in 1993, its competencies in justice and home affairs have developed significantly, evolving from an intergovernmental approach to supranationalism. This development has resulted in EU legislation covering critical areas such as extradition, family law, asylum law, and criminal justice.]

Accordingly, the union has legislated in areas such as extradition,[273] family law,[274] asylum law,[275] and criminal justice.[276]


=== SEGMENT 88 ===
[Summary: The European Union has strengthened its internal security infrastructure by establishing agencies like Europol, CEPOL, and Eurojust to coordinate police cooperation, training, and judicial efforts across member states, while also operating several key databases. Additionally, EU treaties mandate that the union is founded on core values such as democracy, equality, and the rule of law, supporting expanded legislative powers to combat discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.]

The EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecution and civil litigations across the member states: Europol for police co-operation, CEPOL for training of police forces[277] and the Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors and courts.[278] It also operates the EUCARIS database of vehicles and drivers, the Eurodac, the European Criminal Records Information System, the European Cybercrime Centre, FADO, PRADO and others.Prohibitions against discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.[s] The treaties declare that the European Union itself is "founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."[279] By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexism in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.[t]


=== SEGMENT 89 ===
[Summary: The Lisbon Treaty, effective in 2009, granted legal status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, creating a codified standard against which EU legal acts are judged. Historically, the Court of Justice already protected fundamental rights derived from member state constitutional traditions, occasionally invalidating EU legislation. Additionally, the Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR mandated and permitted the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, a step previously unauthorized.]

In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states".[280] The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.[281] Signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership.[u] Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state[v] nor had the competence to accede.[w] The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it.

[Summary: The EU is independent from the Council of Europe but shares fundamental goals concerning human rights and democracy, and relies on the Council for foundational documents like the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU promotes human rights globally, notably requiring the abolition of the death penalty for membership, and in October 2020, it announced plans for a new legal structure to sanction serious human rights violations worldwide.]

The EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas, especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Furthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.[282] On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to create a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses around the world.[283]

[Summary: Sport is primarily the responsibility of EU member states or international organizations, though EU policies have exerted influence, notably through the free movement of workers, which resulted in the Bosman ruling prohibiting quotas on EU foreign players. The Treaty of Lisbon further requires that economic rules applied to sport must consider its specific nature and structures based on voluntary activity, a provision introduced following lobbying by organizations like the IOC and FIFA.]

Sport
Main article: Sport policies of the European Union
Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. There are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU member state citizenship.[288] The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.[289] This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.[290] The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.[291]

[Summary: The segment details two primary symbols of the European Union: the flag and the motto. The flag, featuring 12 golden stars in a circle on a blue background, was originally designed for the Council of Europe in 1955 before being adopted by the European Communities in 1986, with the number twelve symbolizing perfection and entirety. Additionally, the motto "United in Diversity" was adopted in 2000, having been selected from proposals submitted by school pupils.]

The flag of Europe consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background. Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present European Union, in 1986. The Council of Europe gave the flag a symbolic description in the following terms,[292] although the official symbolic description adopted by the EU omits the reference to the "Western world".[293]

Against the blue sky of the Western world, the stars symbolise the peoples of Europe in a form of a circle, the sign of union. The number of stars is invariably twelve, the figure twelve being the symbol of perfection and entirety.

=== SEGMENT 94 ===
[Summary: This segment outlines several key symbolic elements of the EU, including the designation of Europe Day (9 May, commemorating the 1950 Schuman declaration) as the union's flag day since 1985. It identifies the EU anthem as the instrumental prelude to Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," which was adopted by European Community leaders in the same year. Furthermore, the mythological figure Europa and the bull are central symbols, decorating EU institutions, appearing on euro banknotes, and featuring on residence permit cards.]

Since 1985, the flag day of the union has been Europe Day, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 Schuman declaration). The anthem of the EU is an instrumental version of the prelude to the Ode to Joy, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions.[295] Besides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the EU's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of euro banknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.[296]

[Summary: The segment first highlights the symbolic relevance of Charles the Great (Charlemagne), recognized as Pater Europae ("Father of Europe"), noting that the Charlemagne Prize and the Charlemagne Youth Prize are awarded to champions of European unification. It then addresses media freedom, establishing it as a fundamental right for EU citizens and member states, defined in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, guaranteeing media freedom is a key indicator used to assess a country's readiness to join the EU during the enlargement process.]

[Summary: While the majority of media in the European Union remains national-focused, several EU-wide outlets like Euronews and Politico Europe have emerged since the early 1990s. The EU also actively supports culture through initiatives like the Franco-German network Arte and the MEDIA Programme, which aids the European film and audiovisual industries. Furthermore, European integration has demonstrated a significant positive economic impact; a 2019 study indicated that without it, per capita incomes for members joining between 1973 and 2004 would have been approximately 10% lower in their first decade of membership.]

The majority of media in the European Union are national-orientated, although some EU-wide media focusing on European affairs have emerged since the early 1990s, such as Euronews, Eurosport, EUobserver, EURACTIV or Politico Europe.[304][305] Arte is a public Franco-German TV network that promotes programming in the areas of culture and the arts. 80 per cent of its programming are provided in equal proportion by the two member companies, while the remainder is being provided by the European Economic Interest Grouping ARTE GEIE and the channel's European partners.[306] The MEDIA Programme of the European Union has supported the European popular film and audiovisual industries since 1991. It provides support for the development, promotion and distribution of European works within Europe and beyond.[307]InfluenceThe European emblem emblazoned on the Eiffel TowerThe European Union has had a significant positive economic effect on most member states.[308] According to a 2019 study of the member states who joined from 1973 to 2004, "without European integration, per capita incomes would have been, on average, approximately 10% lower in the first ten years after joining the EU".[308]


=== SEGMENT 97 ===
[Summary: The segment discusses the economic and political impacts of the EU, noting that while a 2021 study found the 2004 enlargement benefited all member state groups, earlier analyses identified Greece as an exception up to 2008. The EU is widely credited with promoting peace and democracy in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe post-USSR collapse, which scholar Thomas Risse described as having a 'huge anchoring effect' for new democracies. However, counter-arguments suggest the EU can inadvertently enable democratic backsliding by reluctance to intervene and providing funds, although Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union may constrain countries like Hungary from becoming closed autocracies.]

Greece was the exception reported by the study, which analysed up to 2008, "to avoid confounding effects from the global financial crisis".[308] A 2021 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that the 2004 enlargement had aggregate beneficial economic effects on all groups in both the old and new member states. The largest winners were the new member states, in particular unskilled labour in the new member states.[309]The European Union is frequently cited as having made a major contribution to peace in Europe, in particular by pacifying border disputes,[310][311] and to the spread of democracy, especially by encouraging democratic reforms in aspiring Eastern European member states after the collapse of the USSR.[312][313] Scholar Thomas Risse wrote in 2009, "there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that the EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new democracies."[313] However, R. Daniel Kelemen argues that the EU has proved beneficial to leaders who are overseeing democratic backsliding, as the EU is reluctant to intervene in domestic politics, gives authoritarian governments funds which they can use to strengthen their regimes, and because freedom of movement within the EU allows dissenting citizens to leave their backsliding countries. At the same time, the union might provide through Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union an external constraint that prevents electoral autocracies, currently Hungary,[314] from progressing into closed autocracies.[315]
