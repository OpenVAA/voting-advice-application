[Summary: The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union composed of 27 member states, covering 4,233,255 km2 and having an estimated population exceeding 450 million by 2025. Economically, the EU is highly significant, generating a nominal GDP of approximately €17.935 trillion in 2024, which accounts for about one-sixth of global economic output. Built upon the Customs Union, EU policies focus on maintaining an internal single market that ensures the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital, alongside common policies on trade, agriculture, and regional development.]

The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe.[8][9] The Union has a total area of 4,233,255 km2 (1,634,469 sq mi) and an estimated population of more than 450 million as of 2025. The EU is often described as a sui generis political entity combining characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.[10][11]

Containing 5.5% of the world population in 2023,[12] EU member states generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around €17.935 trillion in 2024, accounting for approximately one sixth of global economic output.[13] Its cornerstone, the Customs Union, paved the way to establishing an internal single market based on standardised legal framework and legislation that applies in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market;[14] enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade,[15] agriculture,[16] fisheries, and regional development.[17]


=== SEGMENT 2 ===
[Summary: The EU has established key operational areas, including the Schengen Area, where passport controls are abolished, and the eurozone, comprising 20 member states that use the euro currency. Internationally, the EU uses the Common Foreign and Security Policy to manage external relations and defense, maintaining diplomatic missions globally and representing itself in major forums (UN, WTO, G7, G20), and was recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012.]

Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.[18] The eurozone is a group composed of the 20 EU member states that have fully implemented the EU's economic and monetary union and use the euro currency. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence. It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.


=== SEGMENT 3 ===
[Summary: The European Union (EU) was formally established, along with its citizenship, when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, and later gained international legal personality via the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009. Its origins trace back to the "Inner Six" states starting modern European integration in 1948, evolving through predecessor organizations like the European Coal and Steel Community. The union grew significantly in size, adding 22 states between 1973 and 2013, though the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave in 2020.]

The EU was established, along with its citizenship, when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, and was incorporated as an international legal juridical person[clarification needed] upon entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.[19] Its beginnings can be traced to the Inner Six states (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) at the start of modern European integration in 1948, and to the Western Union, the International Authority for the Ruhr, the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, which were established by treaties. These increasingly amalgamated bodies grew, with their legal successor the EU, both in size through the accessions of a further 22 states from 1973 to 2013, and in power through acquisitions of policy areas. In 2020, the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU; ten countries are aspiring or negotiating to join it.


=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: The segment outlines the early intellectual and organizational origins of European unity, which gained momentum primarily as a reaction to World War I. Key early proposals included John Maynard Keynes's suggestion of a European customs union in 1920 and the founding of the Paneuropean Union in 1923 by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi. Furthermore, French Prime Minister Aristide Briand advocated for a federal Europe in a significant 1929 speech at the League of Nations to secure peace and resolve the historic Franco-German enmity.]

Background: World Wars and aftermath
Further information: Ideas of European unity before 1948
Internationalism and visions of European unity had existed since well before the 19th century, but gained particularly as a reaction to World War I and its aftermath. In this light the first advances for the idea of European integration were made. In 1920 John Maynard Keynes proposed a European customs union for the struggling post-war European economies,[20] and in 1923 the oldest organisation for European integration, the Paneuropean Union was founded, led by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who later would found in June 1947 the European Parliamentary Union (EPU). Aristide Briand—who was Prime Minister of France, a follower of the Paneuropean Union, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for the Locarno Treaties—delivered a widely recognised speech at the League of Nations in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe and settle the historic Franco-German enmity.[21][22]


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: During World War II, the Allies established common goals through agreements like the 1941 Declaration of St James's Palace and the Atlantic Charter, which also spurred the creation of global institutions such as the United Nations (1945) and the Bretton Woods System (1944). Post-war planning intensified at the 1943 Moscow and Tehran Conferences, culminating in the 1944 Yalta Conference decision to form a European Advisory Commission, which was later replaced by the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Allied Control Council after the 1945 Potsdam Agreement.]

With large-scale war being waged in Europe once again in the 1930s and becoming World War II, the question of what to fight against and what for had to be agreed on. A first agreement was the Declaration of St James's Palace of 1941, when Europe's resistance gathered in London. This was expanded on by the 1941 Atlantic Charter, establishing the Allies and their common goals, inciting a new wave of global international institutions like the United Nations (founded 1945) or the Bretton Woods System (1944).[23]

In 1943 at the Moscow Conference and Tehran Conference, plans to establish joint institutions for a post-war world and Europe increasingly became a part of the agenda. This led to a decision at the Yalta Conference in 1944 to form a European Advisory Commission, later replaced by the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Allied Control Council, following the German surrender and the Potsdam Agreement in 1945.


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: Following World War II, European integration was promoted as a remedy for extreme nationalism, highlighted by Winston Churchill's 1946 speech in Zürich advocating for a "European Union" and "Council of Europe," and the establishment of the French Union. However, 1947 saw the rapid deterioration of East-West relations, marked by the rigged Polish election breaching the Yalta Agreement. This growing rift led to the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk between France and the UK (aimed at the USSR) and the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, committing the US to countering Soviet expansion.]

By the end of the war, European integration became seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism that had caused the war.[24] On 19 September 1946, in a much recognised speech, Winston Churchill, speaking at the University of Zürich, reiterated his calls since 1930 for a "European Union" and "Council of Europe", coincidentally[25] parallel[clarification needed] to the Hertenstein Congress of the Union of European Federalists,[26] one of the then founded and later constituent members of the European Movement. One month later, the French Union was installed by the new Fourth French Republic to direct the decolonisation of its colonies so that they would become parts of a European community.[27]

By 1947, a growing rift between the western Allied Powers and the Soviet Union became evident as a result of the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election, which constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement. March of that year saw two important developments. First was the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk between France and the United Kingdom. The treaty assured mutual assistance in the event of future military aggression against either nation. Though it officially named Germany as a threat, in reality the actual concern was for the Soviet Union. A few days later came the announcement of the Truman Doctrine which pledged American support for democracies to counter the Soviets.


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: The period between 1948 and 1957 initiated institutionalized modern European integration, driven partly by Cold War tensions following the 1948 Communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Key foundational steps in 1948 included the signing of the Treaty of Brussels, which established the Western Union, and the creation of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) to manage the Marshall Plan. This era culminated in the 1951 Treaty of Paris, which established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC).]

An excerpt of the Schuman Declaration, by Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 (Europe Day)

Treaty of Paris (1951), establishing the ECSC
Immediately following the February 1948 coup d'état by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the London Six-Power Conference was held, resulting in the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and its incapacitation, an event marking the beginning of the Cold War. The year 1948 marked the beginning of the institutionalised modern European integration. In March 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed, establishing the Western Union (WU), followed by the International Authority for the Ruhr. Furthermore, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the predecessor of the OECD, was also founded in 1948 to manage the Marshall Plan, which led to the Soviets creating Comecon in response.


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: The Hague Congress of May 1948 marked a pivotal moment in European integration, leading to the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe, and the Council of Europe in 1949. The essential foundation of the EU institutions followed the Schuman Declaration on 9 May 1950, which prompted six nations to draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952, a milestone organization that served as the origin for key EU institutions like the European Commission and Parliament.]

The ensuing Hague Congress of May 1948 was a pivotal moment in European integration, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe,[28] and most importantly to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949 (which is now Europe Day). The Council of Europe was one of the first institutions to bring the sovereign states of (then only Western) Europe together, raising great hopes and fevered debates in the following two years for further European integration.[citation needed] It has since been a broad forum to further cooperation and shared issues, achieving for example the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950.

Essential for the actual birth of the institutions of the EU was the Schuman Declaration on 9 May 1950 (the day after the fifth Victory in Europe Day) and the decision by six nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, and Italy) to follow Schuman and draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty was created in 1952 the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was built on the International Authority for the Ruhr, installed by the Western Allies in 1949 to regulate the coal and steel industries of the Ruhr area in West Germany.[29] Backed by the Marshall Plan with large funds coming from the United States since 1948, the ECSC became a milestone organisation, enabling European economic development and integration and being the origin of the main institutions of the EU such as the European Commission and Parliament.[30]


=== SEGMENT 9 ===
[Summary: Early European integration efforts, particularly concerning the ECSC, were driven by the belief that tying together the essential war industries (coal and steel) would prevent future conflicts. While the Pleven Plan of 1951 failed to establish a European Political Community or Defence Community, significant geopolitical shifts occurred in the mid-1950s: the Western Union became the Western European Union (WEU) in 1954, and West Germany joined NATO and the WEU in 1955, prompting the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact. The 1955 Messina Conference subsequently ordered the Spaak report to recommend further integration steps.]

Founding fathers of the European Union understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, a future war between their nations became much less likely.[31] In parallel with Schuman, the Pleven Plan of 1951 tried but failed to tie the institutions of the developing European community under the European Political Community, which was to include the also proposed European Defence Community, an alternative to West Germany joining NATO which was established in 1949 under the Truman Doctrine. In 1954 the Modified Brussels Treaty transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany eventually joined both the WEU and NATO in 1955, prompting the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact in 1955 as an institutional framework for its military domination in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Assessing the progress of European integration the Messina Conference was held in 1955, ordering the Spaak report, which in 1956 recommended the next significant steps of European integration.

=== SEGMENT 11 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957 by six founding members, established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), both of which came into force in 1958. While the EEC and Euratom initially shared courts and assemblies with the ECSC, internal tensions, particularly from France, marked the 1960s. This period culminated in the 1967 Merger Treaty, which unified the institutions of the three communities into a single entity known as the European Communities.]

of the European Communities (1958–1972)

Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Rome (1957), establishing the EEC
In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) and established a customs union. They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for cooperation in developing nuclear power. Both treaties came into force in 1958.[31] Although the EEC and Euratom were created separately from the ECSC, they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch (Hirsch Commission).[32][33]

The OEEC was in turn reformed in 1961 into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and its membership was extended to states outside of Europe, the United States and Canada. During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached, and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities.[34][35] Jean Rey presided over the first merged commission (Rey Commission).[36]

[Summary: The period between 1973 and 1993 saw the first major enlargement of the European Communities, adding Denmark, Ireland, and the UK in 1973, followed by Greece (1981), and Portugal and Spain (1986). Key developments included the establishment of the CSCE, the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, the signing of the Schengen Agreement in 1985, and the adoption of the Single European Act in 1986.]

In 1973, the communities were enlarged to include Denmark (including Greenland), Ireland, and the United Kingdom.[37] Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum. The Ostpolitik and the ensuing détente led to establishment of a first truly pan-European body, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), predecessor of the modern Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held.[38] Greece joined in 1981. In 1985, Greenland left the Communities, following a dispute over fishing rights. During the same year, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states.[39] In 1986, the Single European Act was signed. Portugal and Spain joined in 1986.[40] In 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the communities as part of a reunified Germany.[41]

[Summary: The European Union was formally established on November 1, 1993, with the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, which also set the stage for future expansion by agreeing upon the Copenhagen criteria. This period saw significant enlargement, including the addition of Austria, Finland, and Sweden in 1995, followed by the largest expansion to date in 2004 when ten new countries joined the union. Furthermore, euro banknotes and coins were introduced in 12 member states in 2002, establishing the euro as the world's second-largest reserve currency.]

Maastricht Treaty (1992), establishing the EU
The European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty—whose main architects were Horst Köhler,[42] Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand—came into force on 1 November 1993.[19][43] The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred to as such before the treaty. With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.[44]

In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU. In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the eurozone has increased to encompass 20 countries. The euro currency became the second-largest reserve currency in the world. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the union.[45]

In 2007, Bulgaria and Romania became EU members. Later that year, Slovenia adopted the euro,[45] followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, Lithuania in 2015, and Croatia in 2023. On 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the EU, merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality, created a permanent president of the European Council, the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy, and strengthened the position of the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy.[46][47]


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: The period between 2012 and 2020 marked both achievements and severe challenges for the European Union. The EU received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 and welcomed Croatia as its 28th member in 2013. However, the decade was defined by tests to cohesion, including the eurozone debt crisis and the 2015 asylum seeker surge, culminating in the UK's withdrawal (Brexit), which formally occurred on January 31, 2020, following a 2016 referendum.]

In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for having "contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy, and human rights in Europe".[48][49] In 2013, Croatia became the 28th EU member.[50] From the beginning of the 2010s, the cohesion of the European Union has been tested by several issues, including a debt crisis in some of the eurozone countries, a surge in asylum seekers in 2015, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.[51] A referendum in the UK on its membership of the European Union was held in 2016, with 51.9 per cent of participants voting to leave.[52] The UK formally notified the European Council of its decision to leave on 29 March 2017, initiating the formal withdrawal procedure for leaving the EU; following extensions to the process, the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, although most areas of EU law continued to apply to the UK for a transition period which lasted until 31 December 2020.[53]


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: The early 2020s saw internal changes within the EU, including Croatia adopting the euro and Denmark abolishing one of its opt-outs, and a historic agreement by EU leaders to create common debt for the first time to finance the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery program following the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the EU responded strongly to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, by imposing heavy sanctions on Russia and funding military aid to Ukraine via the European Peace Facility.]

The early 2020s saw Denmark abolishing one of its three opt-outs and Croatia adopting the euro. After the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU leaders agreed for the first time to create common debt to finance the European Recovery Program called Next Generation EU (NGEU).[54] On 24 February 2022, after massing on the borders of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces undertook an attempt for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[55][56] The European Union imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and agreed on a pooled military aid package to Ukraine for lethal weapons funded via the European Peace Facility off-budget instrument.[57]


=== SEGMENT 17 ===
[Summary: The segment details the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery package, a €750 billion instrument adopted in late 2020 to help member states recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, operating from 2021 to 2026. Furthermore, the EU is prioritizing preparation for a major enlargement, aiming to reach 35 member states by 2030, while facing political uncertainty regarding the outcome of the June 2024 elections due to economic pressures and the war in Ukraine.]

The ancient Roman Agora in Athens illuminated with a Next Generation EU sign
NGEU is a European Commission economic recovery package to support the EU member states to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular those that have been particularly hard hit. It is sometimes styled NextGenerationEU and Next Gen EU, and also called the European Union Recovery Instrument.[58] Agreed in principle by the European Council on 21 July 2020 and adopted on 14 December 2020, the instrument is worth €750 billion. NGEU will operate from 2021 to 2026,[59] and will be tied to the regular 2021–2027 budget of the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The comprehensive NGEU and MFF packages are projected to reach €1824.3 billion.[60]

Preparing the EU for a new great enlargement is one of its political priorities, with the goal of achieving 35 member states by 2030. Institutional and budgetary reforms are being discussed in order for the EU to be ready for the new members.[61][62][63][64] In May 2024, concerns rise, that the outcome of the elections in June, can undermine some of the crucial policies of the EU in the domain of environment, diplomacy, and economy. The war in Ukraine by creating inflation, lowering life level created a possibility of strong changes in the 2024 elections.[65][66]


=== SEGMENT 18 ===
[Summary: The timeline section introduces the European integration project, or 'construction of Europe,' which began after World War II as sovereign European countries started cooperating and pooling sovereignty through treaties. The current European Union (EU) legally evolved from the European Communities (EC), established in the 1950s following the Schuman Declaration. The segment also includes a legend illustrating the relationship between various entities, including the historical pillar structure (EC as Pillar I, CFSP as Pillar II, and JHA/PJCC as Pillar III).]

Timeline
Since the end of World War II, most sovereign European countries have entered into treaties and thereby co-operated and harmonised policies (or pooled sovereignty) in an increasing number of areas, in the European integration project or the construction of Europe (French: la construction européenne). The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)—the principal framework for this unification. The EU inherited many of its present organizations, institutions, and responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration.

Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms.[69] Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).[g] EU policy is in general promulgated by EU directives, which are then implemented in the domestic legislation of its member states, and EU regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states. Lobbying at the EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process.[70]


=== SEGMENT 21 ===
[Summary: The European Union has expanded from six founding states to 27 members, requiring acceding countries to partially delegate sovereignty, a process known as "pooling of sovereignty," in return for institutional representation. To qualify for membership, a country must satisfy the Copenhagen criteria, defined in 1993, which mandate a stable democracy respecting human rights and the rule of law, a functioning market economy, and acceptance of all EU obligations. The European Council is responsible for evaluating a country's fulfillment of these criteria.]

Member statesMain article: Member state of the European UnionMap showing the member states of the European Union (clickable)Through successive enlargements, the EU and its predecessors have grown from the six founding states of the EEC to 27 members. Countries accede to the union by becoming a party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".[71][72] In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the union. Examples of such alliances include the Baltic Assembly, the Benelux Union, the Bucharest Nine, the Craiova Group, the EU Med Group, the Lublin Triangle, the New Hanseatic League, the Three Seas Initiative, the Visegrád Group, and the Weimar Triangle.To become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.[73]

[Summary: The segment outlines the relationships between the EU and non-member European states, noting that the four EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) maintain economic ties through the EEA or bilateral agreements, while microstates like Andorra and Vatican City cooperate with the EU, often using the euro. Additionally, it introduces the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), an EU-developed geocode standard adopted in 2003 for statistical purposes, which is crucial for managing EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.]

The four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.[74][75] The relationships of the European microstates Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.[76]List of member states in the European Union SubdivisionsMain article: Nomenclature of Territorial Units for StatisticsSubdivisions of member-states are based on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), a geocode standard for statistical purposes. The standard, adopted in 2003, is developed and regulated by the European Union, and thus only covers the member states of the EU in detail. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics is instrumental in the European Union's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund delivery mechanisms and for locating the area where goods and services subject to European public procurement legislation are to be delivered.

[Summary: The governance of the European Union is based on the principle that member states retain all powers unless they have collectively delegated them to the Union, although the exact delimitation of these powers is sometimes legally disputed. The distribution of legislative competence is divided into three categories: exclusive competence (where only the EU legislates), shared competence (where both can legislate, but the EU takes precedence), and supporting competence (where the EU can only coordinate or supplement member state action).]

GovernanceMain articles: Bodies of the European Union and the Euratom, Institutions of the European Union, and Subsidiarity (European Union) § EU competencesMember states retain in principle all powers except those that they have agreed collectively to delegate to the Union as a whole, though the exact delimitation has on occasions become a subject of scholarly or legal disputes.[86][87] In certain fields, members have awarded exclusive competence and exclusive mandate to the Union. These are areas in which member states have entirely renounced their own capacity to enact legislation. In other areas, the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, the member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas, the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.[88] That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area. The distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided into the following three categories:

[Summary: The text outlines the division of legislative powers between the European Union and its member states, focusing on Exclusive and Shared competences. Exclusive competence grants the EU sole authority in areas like the customs union, competition rules for the internal market, monetary policy for Eurozone members, and the Common Commercial Policy. Shared competence covers broad fields such as the internal market, environment, transport, and energy, where member states can only legislate if the EU has not yet exercised its authority.]

[Summary: The European Union operates under "Supporting competence" in areas like research, technological development, and humanitarian aid, where its actions do not prevent Member States from exercising their own authority. The EU is governed by seven principal institutions, including the European Parliament, the European Council, and the European Commission, each assigned specific roles such as legislative scrutiny, executive functions, determining monetary policy, and ensuring the application of EU law.]

Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.

The high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy (presently Kaja Kallas) also takes part in its meetings. Described by some as the union's "supreme political leadership",[90] it is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies. Its leadership role involves solving disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolving any political crises or disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts as a "collective head of state" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).[91] Tasks for the president of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU,[92] driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU and based in Strasbourg.

It also serves as the 'guardian of the Treaties,' ensuring their efficient operation and policing. The Commission comprises 27 European commissioners, led by the President (currently Ursula von der Leyen), who is proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament.]

The European Commission acts both as the EU's executive arm, responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, and also the legislative initiator, with the sole power to propose laws for debate.[93][94][95] The commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.[96] It has 27 European commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. The leader of the 27 is the president of the European Commission (presently Ursula von der Leyen for 2019–2024, reelected for the 2024–2029 term), proposed by the European Council, following and taking into account the result of the European elections, and is then elected by the European Parliament.[97]

[Summary: The President of the European Commission maintains final authority over accepting or rejecting commissioner candidates proposed by member states and oversees the commission's permanent civil service. The selection process involves member states nominating candidates, the European Council choosing the High Representative (who serves ex-officio as a Vice-President), and the Council of the European Union appointing the remaining 25 commissioners in agreement with the President. The entire body of 27 commissioners must ultimately be approved by a vote of the European Parliament.]

The President retains, as the leader responsible for the entire cabinet, the final say in accepting or rejecting a candidate submitted for a given portfolio by a member state, and oversees the commission's permanent civil service. After the President, the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy, who is ex-officio a vice-president of the European Commission and is also chosen by the European Council.[98] The other 25 commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated president. The 27 commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by a vote of the European Parliament. All commissioners are first nominated by the government of the respective member state.[99]

It consists of a representative from each member state's government and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body. In addition to the legislative functions, members of the council also have executive responsibilities, such as the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and the coordination of broad economic policies within the Union.[103] The Presidency of the council rotates between member states, with each holding it for six months. Beginning on 1 July 2025, the position is held by Denmark.[2]

[Summary: The European Parliament (EP) is one of the EU's three legislative institutions, tasked with amending and approving proposals from the European Commission alongside the Council of the European Union. The EP consists of 705 members (MEPs) who are directly elected by EU citizens every five years based on proportional representation, sitting according to political groups rather than nationality. The Parliament holds crucial powers, including the joint approval of nearly all legislation (like the EU budget), the final approval of the Commission's membership, and the ability to attempt motions of censure.]

The European Parliament is one of three legislative institutions of the EU, which together with the Council of the European Union is tasked with amending and approving the European Commission's proposals. 705 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation. MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.[104] In the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Commission proposes legislation, which requires the joint approval of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pass. This process applies to nearly all areas, including the EU budget. The parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the Court of Justice. The president of the European Parliament carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally. The president and vice-presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.[105]

[Summary: The judicial branch of the European Union is formally known as the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which consists of the Court of Justice and the General Court. The Court of Justice serves as the supreme court for EU law, responsible for interpreting and ensuring its uniform application across all member states. Established in 1952 and based in Luxembourg, the CJEU's case-law dictates that EU law has supremacy over any national law that is inconsistent with it.]

Judicial branchMain article: Court of Justice of the European UnionPortrait of Koen LenaertsKoen Lenaerts,President of the Court of JusticeThe judicial branch of the European Union is formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and consists of two courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court.[106] The Court of Justice is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the CJEU, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its uniform application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court was established in 1952, and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state – currently 27 – although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or fifteen judges. The Court has been led by president Koen Lenaerts since 2015. The CJEU is the highest court of the European Union in matters of Union law. Its case-law provides that EU law has supremacy over any national law that is inconsistent with EU law.[107]

[Summary: The CJEU primarily interacts with national judiciaries through the preliminary reference mechanism, interpreting questions of EU law referred by national courts, which then apply the resulting ruling to their specific cases. The CJEU also functions as an administrative and constitutional court, ensuring the consistent application of EU law across the EU and possessing the power to annul or invalidate unlawful acts of EU institutions and bodies.]

It is not possible to appeal against the decisions of national courts in the CJEU, but rather national courts refer questions of EU law to the CJEU (a preliminary reference). However, it is ultimately for the national court to apply the resulting interpretation (the preliminary ruling) to the facts of any given case. Although, only courts of final appeal are bound to refer a question of EU law when one is addressed. The treaties give the CJEU the power for consistent application of EU law across the EU as a whole. The court also acts as an administrative and constitutional court between the other EU institutions and the Member States and can annul or invalidate unlawful acts of EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.

[Summary: The General Court is a constituent court of the European Union that primarily hears actions brought by individuals and member states against EU institutions, with its decisions appealable to the Court of Justice only on points of law. Historically known as the Court of First Instance before the Lisbon Treaty, the General Court's role expanded significantly in October 2024. Since then, it shares jurisdiction with the Court of Justice over preliminary rulings in six specific areas, including VAT, excise duties, and the Customs Code.]

The General Court is a constituent court of the European Union. It hears actions taken against the institutions of the European Union by individuals and member states, although certain matters are reserved for the Court of Justice. Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a point of law. Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance. Since the amendments to the Statute of the CJEU in October 2024, the Court of Justice shares its jurisdiction over references for a preliminary ruling with the General Court.[108] The General Court is since then competent to handle preliminary references falling under one of the six following areas: the common system of value added tax; excise duties; the Customs Code; the tariff classification of goods under the Combined Nomenclature; compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding or delay or cancellation of transport services; the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.[109]

The ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ECB beforehand. The bank also operates the T2 (RTGS) payments system. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) consists of the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of all 27 member states of the European Union. The ESCB is not the monetary authority of the eurozone, because not all EU member states have joined the euro. The ESCB's objective is price stability throughout the European Union. Secondarily, the ESCB's goal is to improve monetary and financial cooperation between the Eurosystem and member states outside the eurozone.The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the auditory branch of the European Union.

Lacking a formal constitution, its status is instead defined by the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The EU is considered more integrated than a traditional confederation due to its widespread use of qualified majority voting in decision-making, moving beyond exclusive reliance on unanimity.]

(It does not have a formal constitution: its status is defined by the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). It is more integrated than a traditional confederation of states because the general level of government widely employs qualified majority voting in some decision-making among the member states, rather than relying exclusively on unanimity.[118][119]

[Summary: The EU is considered less integrated than a federal state because it is not a sovereign state in its own right, with sovereignty flowing from the individual member states rather than a central whole. This limited integration is reflected in the member states retaining control over constitutional change (Kompetenz-kompetenz), armed force, and taxation, alongside the right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Additionally, the principle of subsidiarity ensures that only matters requiring collective determination are handled collectively.]

The EU is less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several peoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single undifferentiated whole. This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called Kompetenz-kompetenz); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of subsidiarity requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined.


=== SEGMENT 43 ===
[Summary: The legal framework of the EU is defined by the principle of supremacy, which mandates that national courts enforce ratified EU treaties even when they conflict with domestic law. This doctrine, along with direct effect, was developed by the Court of Justice in the 1960s, rather than being explicitly stated in the treaties. The EU's foundation rests on a series of power-giving treaties (Primary Law) that grant the union legal personality and the authority to enact legislation directly affecting member states and their inhabitants.]

Under the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.[i] The direct effect and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman Robert Lecourt.[120] The question whether the secondary law enacted by the EU has a comparable status in relation to national legislation, has been a matter of debate among legal scholars.Primary lawThe European Union is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.[121] These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation[j] which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.[k] The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.[122]

[Summary: The main legal acts of the European Union's secondary law are regulations, directives, and decisions, all of which hold equal legal value and apply without formal hierarchy. Regulations are immediately binding in all member states and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. Directives require member states to achieve a specific result while allowing them discretion on the method of implementation, while decisions are targeted legal acts applying only to specified individuals or member states, often used in competition law.]

Secondary lawThe main legal acts of the European Union come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,[l] and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.[j] Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.[m] When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states. Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.[123]

[Summary: Foreign policy cooperation among EU member states began in 1957, initially centered on negotiating international trade as a bloc. This coordination formalized over time, starting with the European Political Cooperation (EPC) in 1970, which was later renamed the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty. The CFSP promotes EU interests, human rights, and democracy, but requires unanimity among member states, a requirement that sometimes results in policy disagreements, such as those seen during the war in Iraq.]

Foreign relationsMain article: Foreign relations of the European UnionSee also: European External Action ServicePortrait of Kaja KallasKaja Kallas,High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyForeign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the EU's common commercial policy.[124] Steps for more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.[125]The stated aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.[126] The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq.[127]

[Summary: The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is coordinated by the High Representative, who leads the European External Action Service (EEAS). The EEAS, operational since December 2010, functions as the EU's foreign ministry and diplomatic corps. Beyond formal policy, the EU exerts significant international influence, often referred to as "soft power," by using the incentive of enlargement to drive political and economic reforms in prospective member states.]

The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The high representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department[128] that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.[129] The EEAS serves as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union.[130]Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.[131]:

[Summary: The European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, known as ECHO, provides EU humanitarian aid to developing countries. In 2012, ECHO's budget was €874 million, with 51% allocated to Africa and 40% distributed across Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Pacific, Middle East, and Mediterranean regions. This aid is financed primarily through the EU budget (70%) and supplemented by the European Development Fund (30%), utilizing geographic instruments like the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), which allocated €16.9 billion between 2007 and 2013 and mandates that 95% of its budget be spent on official development assistance (ODA).]

"ECHO", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2012, its budget amounted to €874 million, 51 per cent of the budget went to Africa and 20 per cent to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20 per cent to the Middle East and Mediterranean.[133] Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70 per cent) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30 per cent).[134] The EU's external action financing is divided into geographic instruments and thematic instruments.[134] The geographic instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95 per cent of its budget on official development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes.[134]

[Summary: The European Union employs the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) as a foreign relations instrument to strengthen ties with countries located to its east and south, many of which are developing nations aspiring to future EU membership or closer integration. The EU offers financial assistance to these countries, but this aid is strictly conditional upon them meeting requirements for government and economic reform and other positive transformations. This cooperative process is formalized through an Action Plan agreed upon by both Brussels and the target country.]

The European Union uses foreign relations instruments like the European Neighbourhood Policy which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union, or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.

There is also the worldwide European Union Global Strategy. International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily. Its role was recognised in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa; and the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements are the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognise that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas – people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership – in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity.

The predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes.[139] In 2025, Europe initiated the ReArm program, a strategic breakthrough aimed at mobilising local industrial capabilities and bolstering European equipment production, involves a financial investment of €800 billion to support the development and procurement, simultaneously enhancing the continent's overall military readiness and self-sufficiency.[140][141][142]

[Summary: The EU's defense landscape is characterized by 23 members belonging to NATO, while the remaining states maintain neutrality. Following the closure of the Western European Union in 2011, the EU absorbed its defense role and has since pursued autonomous military capacity, a goal set after the 1999 Kosovo War. Recent initiatives, such as the 2022 Strategic Compass, have led to the creation of the EU Battlegroups (deploying 1500 personnel) and a commitment to forming a 5,000-strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity, all while reaffirming the bloc's partnership with NATO.]

Twenty-three EU members are members of NATO while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.[143] The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, closed in 2011[144] as its role had been transferred to the EU.[145] Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel.[146] The EU Strategic Compass adopted in 2022 reaffirmed the bloc's partnership with NATO, committed to increased military mobility and formation of a 5,000-strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity[147]

Since the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, France is the only member officially recognised as a nuclear weapon state and the sole holder of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. France and Italy are also the only EU countries that have power projection capabilities outside of Europe.[148] Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium participate in NATO nuclear sharing.[149] Most EU member states opposed the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty.[150]

[Summary: The European Union Military Staff (EUMS) serves as the EU's highest military institution, established following the 1999 Helsinki European Council, responsible for directing military activities, planning missions under the Common Security and Defence Policy, and advising the Political and Security Committee. Furthermore, the EU manages border security through the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), which targets illegal immigration and trafficking, and utilizes common databases like the Schengen Information System to manage cross-border crime associated with the Schengen Area.]

The European Union Military Staff is the highest military institution of the European Union, established within the framework of the European Council, and follows on from the decisions of the Helsinki European Council (10–11 December 1999), which called for the establishment of permanent political-military institutions. The European Union Military Staff is under the authority of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Political and Security Committee. It directs all military activities in the EU context, including planning and conducting military missions and operations in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy and the development of military capabilities, and provides the Political and Security Committee with military advice and recommendations on military issues. In an EU consisting of 27 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states.[153]

The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) is an agency of the EU aiming to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration.[154] The EU also operates the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, the Entry/Exit System, the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and the Common European Asylum System which provide common databases for police and immigration authorities. The impetus for the development of this co-operation was the advent of open borders in the Schengen Area and the associated cross-border crime.[18]

The EU's member states cover an area of 4,233,262 square kilometres (1,634,472 sq mi),[n] and therefore a large part of the European continent. The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps, 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft) above sea level.[155] The lowest points in the EU are Lammefjorden, Denmark, and Zuidplaspolder, Netherlands, at 7 m (23 ft) below sea level.[156] The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006 mi) long. In addition to national territories in Europe, there are 32 special territories of members of the European Economic Area, not all of which are part of the EU. The largest by area is Greenland, which is not part of the EU but whose citizens are EU citizens, while the largest by population are the Canary Islands off Africa, which are part of the EU and the Schengen area.

The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.[159]

[Summary: The EU's environmental policy has expanded from a regional focus to demonstrating global leadership, notably in securing the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and strengthening its ambitions through the Lisbon Treaty. Mitigating climate change is a top priority, leading to key targets set in 2007, including achieving 20% renewable energy use and reducing CO2 emissions by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. The EU claims its greenhouse gas emissions were 23% lower in 2018 compared to 1990 levels.]

Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,[161] which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.[158] EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.[159]Mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20 per cent of the energy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels.[162] In 2017, the EU emitted 9.1 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions.[163] The European Union claims that already in 2018, its GHG emissions were 23% lower than in 1990.[164]

Following increased political support for green parties in 2019, the EU formalized ambitious climate targets in the June 2021 European Climate Law, mandating a 55% GHG reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, despite initial opposition from four member states. Furthermore, the EU has committed to international climate action, including a joint pledge with the US to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030 and joining the Global carbon market coalition in 2025.]

The EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy.[165] The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city. In the 2019 elections to the European Parliament, the green parties increased their power, possibly because of the rise of post materialist values.[166] Proposals to reach a zero carbon economy in the European Union by 2050 were suggested in 2018–2019. Almost all member states supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland disagreed.[167] In June 2021, the European Union passed a European Climate Law with targets of 55% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.[168] Also in the same year, the European Union and the United States pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The pledge is considered as a big achievement for climate change mitigation.[169] A research report from November 2024 declared that the Czech Republic is the EU's most toxic country in Europe for care emissions.[170]In 2025, The European Union together with China, Brazil and others, joined the Global carbon market coalition.[171] According to some calculations, a global carbon market can speed up emission reduction seven-fold.[172]

[Summary: The text outlines the requirements for EU states wishing to join the monetary union, mandating that they first join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and adhere to strict financial obligations under the Maastricht Treaty, including budgetary discipline and limiting government debt. Furthermore, it discusses the free movement of capital, which permits the movement of investments between countries and is unique because it is granted equally to non-member states.]

The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level, as agreed in the European Fiscal Pact.Capital Markets Union and financial institutionsMain articles: Capital Markets Union, European System of Financial Supervision, and European Stability MechanismSee also: European Banking Authority, European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority, and Single Resolution BoardFree movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.[179] Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.

Globally, the euro is the second largest reserve and second most traded currency after the US dollar.]

The European System of Financial Supervision is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the central bank. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.[180]Eurozone and banking unionMain articles: Euro, Eurozone, and European banking unionSee also: Eurosystem and EurogroupEuro banknotes from the Europa series (since 2013)European Central Bank in Frankfurt, GermanyIn 1999, the currency union started to materialise through introducing a common accounting (virtual) currency in eleven of the member states. In 2002, it was turned into a fully-fledged conventible currency, when euro notes and coins were issued, while the phaseout of national currencies in the eurozone (consisting by then of 12 member states) was initiated. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 20 countries.[181][182]The 20 EU member states known collectively as the eurozone have fully implemented the currency union by superseding their national currencies with the euro.

Additionally, the text notes that the EU is represented in the World Trade Organization (WTO), reflecting the original core objectives of the European Economic Community to develop a common market and a customs union.]

The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the ECB.[187] The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability. It is at the centre of the Eurosystem, which comprehends all the eurozone national central banks.[188] The ECB is also the central institution of the Banking Union established within the eurozone, as the hub of European Banking Supervision.

While services account for 60 per cent to 70 per cent of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006 which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.[189] According to the treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.Customs unionMain article: European Union Customs UnionEuropean Customs Union  EU member states  Non-EU states which participateThe customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market.

It is a unique entity because it is a collection of countries that have united to form a single market and a customs union. The EU is a political and economic union of 27 member states primarily located in Europe. The EU has a population of about 447 million people. The EU has a complex structure with various institutions, including the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the European Court of Auditors. The EU operates through a system of supranational institutions and intergovernmental decision-making. The EU's policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. The EU has played a significant role in promoting peace, democracy, and cooperation among its member states and globally. The EU's origins can be traced back to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1951 by six founding members: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. The ECSC was created to prevent future wars between France and Germany by pooling their coal and steel production under a common high authority. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community (EEC), which aimed to create a common market. The EEC gradually expanded its membership and scope, leading to the establishment of the European Union under the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. The EU has undergone several enlargements, with the most recent being Croatia in 2013. The United Kingdom is the only member state to have left the EU, doing so in 2020. The EU is a major global economic power, with the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP and the largest by purchasing power parity. The euro, the currency of the Eurozone, is used by 20 of the 27 member states. The EU is also a significant player in international affairs, with a common foreign and security policy. The EU's influence extends to various areas, including environmental protection, human rights, and development aid. The EU faces ongoing challenges, including economic disparities among member states, migration issues, and political disagreements. Despite these challenges, the EU remains a unique and important entity in the global landscape.]

The European Union Association Agreement does something similar for a much larger range of countries, partly as a so-called soft approach ('a carrot instead of a stick') to influence the politics in those countries. The European Union represents all its members at the World Trade Organization (WTO), and acts on behalf of member states in any disputes. When the EU negotiates trade related agreement outside the WTO framework, the subsequent agreement must be approved by each individual EU member state government.[191]Competition and consumer protectionMain articles: European Union competition law and European consumer lawSee also: European Union Intellectual Property OfficeThe EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.[o] In 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (General Electric and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority.[192] Another high-profile case, against Microsoft, resulted in the commission fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action.[193]

[Summary: The European Union operates a robust external trade policy, having concluded numerous free trade agreements worldwide, including the notable EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, which became the world's largest bilateral free trade deal upon its implementation in 2019. The EU is the world's largest exporter, and its services trade surplus grew significantly, rising from $16 billion in 2000 to over $250 billion in 2018. In 2020, China temporarily displaced the United States as the EU's largest trading partner.]

External tradeMain article: Common Commercial Policy (EU)EU free trade agreements  European Union  Agreement in force  Agreement (in part) provisionally appliedThe European Union has concluded free trade agreements (FTAs)[194] and other agreements with a trade component with many countries worldwide and is negotiating with many others.[195] The European Union's services trade surplus rose from $16 billion in 2000 to more than $250 billion in 2018.[196] In 2020, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China became the EU's largest trading partner, displacing the United States.[197] The European Union is the largest exporter in the world[198] and in 2008 was the largest importer of goods and services.[199][200] Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as tariffs and border controls. In the eurozone, trade is helped by not having any currency differences to deal with amongst most members.[191] Externally, the EU's free-trade agreement with Japan is perhaps its most notable one. The EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement was officially signed on 17 July 2018, becoming the world's largest bilateral free trade deal when it went into effect on 1 February 2019, creating an open trade zone covering nearly one-third of global GDP.[201][202]

[Summary: The EU's total energy supply in 2019 was 59 billion GJ, representing 10.2% of the world total, with oil (31.7%) and natural gas (24.7%) being the largest components, and approximately three-fifths of the supply coming from imports. The EU has a mandatory and comprehensive energy policy, approved in 2005, which focuses on five key points, including increasing internal market competition, diversifying resources, improving efficiency, and boosting renewable energy commercialization.]

Approximately three fifths of the energy available in the EU came from imports (mostly of fossil fuels). Renewable energy contributed 18.1 per cent of the EU's total energy supply in 2019, and 11.1 per cent of the final energy consumption.[204] The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.[205]Energy CommunityThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia[206] and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.[205]

[Summary: The EU has historically been highly dependent on imports for energy, notably importing 82% of its oil and 57% of its natural gas in 2007, with Russia, Norway, and Algeria being the largest natural gas suppliers. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EU began preparing sanctions targeting Russian oil and banks in May 2022. Concurrently, the European Commission launched the €300 billion RePowerEU initiative in May 2022, which aims to eliminate EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2030 and accelerate the clean energy transition.]

In 2007, EU countries as a whole imported 82 per cent of their oil, 57 per cent of their natural gas[207] and 97.48 per cent of their uranium[208] demands. The three largest suppliers of natural gas to the European Union are Russia, Norway and Algeria, that amounted for about three quarters of the imports in 2019.[209] There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been attempting to reduce.[210]In May 2022, it was reported that the European Union was preparing another sanction against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. It is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks, as well as individuals and companies. According to an article by Reuters, two diplomats stated that the European Union may impose a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022.[211] Also in May 2022, the European Commission published the RePowerEU initiative, a €300 billion plan outlining the path towards the end of EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2030 and the acceleration on the clean energy transition.[212]TransportMain article: Transport in the European UnionFurther information: Trans-European Transport NetworkSee also: European Union Aviation Safety Agency, European Maritime Safety Agency, and European Union Agency for Railways

TEN-T comprises two network layers: the Core Network, which is to be completed by 2030; and the Comprehensive Network, which is to be completed by 2050. The network is currently made up of 9 core corridors: the Baltic–Adriatic Corridor, the North Sea–Baltic Corridor, the Mediterranean Corridor, the Orient/East–Med Corridor, the Scandinavian–Mediterranean Corridor, the Rhine–Alpine Corridor, the Atlantic Corridor, the North Sea–Mediterranean Corridor, and the Rhine–Danube Corridor. Road transportation was organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European road network. Bundesautobahn 7 is the longest national motorway in the EU at 963 km (598 mi).

The sector is liberalized by the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA), which creates a single aviation market, and is regulated for safety by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), established in 2002. The Single European Sky (SES) initiative also works to reform air traffic management, while rail transport is organized under the Trans-European Rail network.]

Air transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Airport network. European airports are categorised as international, community, or regional. The Charles de Gaulle Airport is the busiest in the EU, located in and near the city of Paris, in France.[216] The European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) is a single market in aviation. ECAA agreements were signed on 5 May 2006 in Salzburg, Austria between the EU and some third countries. The ECAA liberalises the air transport industry by allowing any company from any ECAA member state to fly between any ECAA member states airports, thereby allowing a "foreign" airline to provide domestic flights. The Single European Sky (SES) is an initiative that seeks to reform the European air traffic management system through a series of actions carried out in four different levels (institutional, operational, technological and control and supervision) with the aim of satisfying the needs of the European airspace in terms of capacity, safety, efficiency and environmental impact. Civil aviation safety is under the responsibility of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It carries out certification, regulation and standardisation and also performs investigation and monitoring. The idea of a European-level aviation safety authority goes back to 1996, but the agency was only legally established in 2002, and began operating in 2003.Rail transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Rail network, made up of the high-speed rail n

Map of the Schengen Area  Schengen Area  Countries de facto participating  Members of the EU committed by treaty to join the Schengen Area in the futureThe Schengen Area is an area comprising 29 European countries that have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders. Being an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice policy of the EU, it mostly functions as a single jurisdiction under a common visa policy for international travel purposes. The area is named after the 1985 Schengen Agreement and the 1990 Schengen Convention, both signed in Schengen, Luxembourg. Of the 27 EU member states, 25 participate in the Schengen Area. Of the EU members that are not part of the Schengen Area, one—Cyprus—is legally obligated to join the area in the future; Ireland maintains an opt-out, and instead operates its own visa policy. The four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, are not members of the EU, but have signed agreements in association with the Schengen Agreement. Also, three European microstates – Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City – maintain open borders for passenger traffic with their neighbours, and are therefore considered de facto members of the Schengen Area due to the practical impossibility of travelling to or from them without transiting through at least one Schengen member country.

This was the first common political framework for space activities established by the EU. Each member state has pursued to some extent their own national space policy, though often co-ordinating through the ESA. Günter Verheugen, the European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, has stated that even though the EU is "a world leader in the technology", it was "being put on the defensive by the United States and Russia and that it only has about a 10-year technological advantage on China and India, which are racing to catch up".

[Summary: The segment describes the European Union's major space initiatives, focusing on navigation and Earth observation. Galileo, the EU's €10 billion Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) launched in 2016, provides independent, high-precision positioning to avoid reliance on US GPS or Russian GLONASS. Additionally, the EU operates the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) for augmenting positioning data and the Copernicus Programme, a comprehensive Earth observation initiative managed by EUSPA and ESA, aimed at environmental management and civil security.]

Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that went live in 2016, created by the EU through the ESA, operated by the EUSPA, with two ground operations centres in Fucino, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The €10 billion project is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European political and military authorities do not have to rely on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) developed by the ESA and EUROCONTROL. Currently, it supplements the GPS by reporting on the reliability and accuracy of their positioning data and sending out corrections. The system will supplement Galileo in a future version. The Copernicus Programme is the EU's Earth observation programme coordinated and managed by EUSPA in partnership with ESA. It aims at achieving a global, continuous, autonomous, high quality, wide range Earth observation capacity, providing accurate, timely and easily accessible information to, among other things, improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, and ensure civil security.

At 25 million square kilometres, it is the largest in the world.[219]The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has since then undergone several changes to reduce the EEC budget cost (from 73% in 1985 to 37% in 2017) and consider rural development in its aims. It has, however, been criticised on the grounds of its cost and its environmental and humanitarian effects.Likewise, the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union. It sets quotas for which member states are allowed to catch each type of fish, as well as encouraging the fishing industry by various market interventions and fishing subsidies. It was introduced in 2009 with the Treaty of Lisbon, which formally enshrined fisheries conservation policy as one of the handful of "exclusive competences" reserved for the European Union.

[Summary: The EU's labor framework is built upon the free movement of persons, which allows citizens to live, work, study, or retire freely across member states, necessitating the recognition of professional qualifications. To mitigate the effects of free markets, the EU protects workers' rights and prevents social dumping through legislation, including the Working Time Directive and the European Directive about Minimum Wage, which was approved by the European Parliament in September 2022.]

LabourSee also: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, European Labour Authority, European Training Foundation, and EURESThe free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.[220] The EU seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent in September 2018.[221] The euro area unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent.[221] Among the member states, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3 per cent), Germany and Poland (both 3.4 per cent), and the highest in Spain (10.61 per cent in 2024)[222] and Greece (9.6 per cent in November 2024).[223] The European Union has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting workers' rights and preventing social and environmental dumping.[citation needed] To this end, it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the Working Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The European Directive about Minimum Wage, which looks to lift minimum wages and strengthen collective bargaining was approved by the European Parliament in September 2022.[224]

Most EU institutions use only a handful of working languages: the European Commission conducts its internal business in three procedural languages: English, French, and German;[236] the Court of Justice uses French as the working language,[237] and the European Central Bank conducts its business primarily in English.[238][239] Even though language policy is the responsibility of member states, EU institutions promote multilingualism among its citizens.[j][240]

The most widely spoken language in the EU is English; the language is spoken by 50 per cent of the population[233] and studied by 95 per cent of school students,[241] although following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom only 2% of the population speak it natively.[233] German and French are spoken by 29 per cent and 25 per cent of the population. More than half (59 per cent) of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue, and more than a tenth (11%) are quadrilingual.[233]

Luxembourgish (in Luxembourg) and Turkish (in Cyprus) are the only two national languages that are not official languages of the EU. Catalan, Galician and Basque are not recognised official languages of the EU but have official status in Spain. Therefore, official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens have the right to correspond with the institutions in these languages.[242][243] There are about 150 regional and minority languages in the EU, spoken by up to 50 million people.[244] The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage. The European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe.[245]

[Summary: The European Union maintains no formal connection to any religion, although its treaties acknowledge the status of religious and philosophical organizations and reference Europe's cultural, religious, and humanist inheritance. According to 2015 data, Christianity was the dominant affiliation (71.6%), with Catholicism being the largest single group (45.3%). A significant portion of the EU population (24.0%) was categorized as irreligious.]

The EU has no formal connection to any religion. Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union[246] recognises the "status under national law of churches and religious associations" as well as that of "philosophical and non-confessional organisations".[247] The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe".[247][248] Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or a god, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.[249]

[Summary: The EU population is religiously diverse, including major Christian denominations (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox) alongside significant Muslim (estimated 13 million in 2009) and Jewish populations (over a million). While a 2005 poll indicated that 52% of EU citizens believed in a god, religious belief varies widely across member states, with Malta, Cyprus, and Romania being the most religious, and Estonia and the Czech Republic being the least. Furthermore, belief tends to be higher among specific demographics, including women, older people, and those on the political right.]

Christians in the EU include Catholics of both Roman and Eastern Rite, numerous Protestant denominations with Lutherans, Anglicans, and Reformed forming the majority of Protestant affiliations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million,[250] and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.[251] The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population. Eurostat's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52 per cent of EU citizens believed in a god, 27 per cent in "some sort of spirit or life force", and 18 per cent had no form of belief.[252]

Into the 21st century, many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership.[253] The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16 per cent) and the Czech Republic (19 per cent).[252] The most religious countries were Malta (95 per cent, predominantly Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90 per cent of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16, and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale".[252]

Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Renaissance humanist after whom the Erasmus Programme is named
Basic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years, it supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and became a symbol of European student life.[254]

[Summary: The EU maintains educational initiatives, such as the Lifelong Learning Programme (2007–2013), designed to promote cross-border knowledge sharing and support the Bologna Process for compatible degrees across Europe. Scientific development is managed through the Framework Programmes, which began in 1984, aiming to coordinate research and allocate funds via the independent European Research Council. These research efforts often focus on strategic areas like developing renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on imported fuels.]

There are similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.[255][256] Through its support of the Bologna Process, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe. Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.[257] EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.[258]

Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that "A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities". The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.[259][260][261]

The EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states. Since 2019 there has been a European commissioner for equality and the European Institute for Gender Equality has existed since 2007. A Directive on countering gender-based violence has been proposed.[268][269] In September 2022, a European Care strategy was approved in order to provide "quality, affordable and accessible care services".[270] The European Social Charter is the main body that recognises the social rights of European citizens. In 2020, the first ever European Union Strategy on LGBTIQ equality was approved under Helena Dalli mandate.[271] In December 2021, the commission announced the intention of codifying a union-wide law against LGBT hate crimes.[272]

[Summary: The EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees a wide range of political, social, and economic rights for its citizens. Since 1993, the EU has significantly expanded its supranational legislative powers in the area of justice and home affairs, covering fields such as extradition, asylum law, and criminal justice. To ensure cross-border coordination, the EU has established specialized agencies like Europol (police cooperation), CEPOL (police training), and Eurojust (cooperation between prosecutors and courts), and operates several key databases and information systems.]

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union contains a wide range of political, social, and economic rights for EU citizens.
Since the creation of the European Union in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs; initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. Accordingly, the union has legislated in areas such as extradition,[273] family law,[274] asylum law,[275] and criminal justice.[276]

The EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecution and civil litigations across the member states: Europol for police co-operation, CEPOL for training of police forces[277] and the Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors and courts.[278] It also operates the EUCARIS database of vehicles and drivers, the Eurodac, the European Criminal Records Information System, the European Cybercrime Centre, FADO, PRADO and others.

Furthermore, the treaties declare the EU is founded on core values including human dignity, democracy, equality, and respect for human rights, leading to enacted legislation on issues such as sexism in the workplace and racial discrimination.]

Prohibitions against discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.[s] The treaties declare that the European Union itself is "founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."[279] By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexism in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.[t]

[Summary: The Lisbon Treaty, enacted in 2009, gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, establishing it as a codified catalogue against which the EU's legal acts are judged. This Charter consolidates rights previously recognized by the Court of Justice, which has historically invalidated EU legislation failing to adhere to fundamental rights. Furthermore, the Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR changed the legal framework, binding the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which is a standing condition for EU membership.]

In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states".[280] The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.[281] Signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership.[u] Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state[v] nor had the competence to accede.[w] The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it.

[Summary: The European Union maintains independence from the Council of Europe, despite sharing common goals and relying on the Council for foundational documents like the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU is a global proponent of human rights, actively opposing the death penalty—making its abolition a condition for membership—and, as of October 2020, planning a new legal structure to sanction serious human rights violations worldwide.]

The EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas, especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Furthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.[282] On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to create a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses around the world.[283]

[Summary: While sport is primarily the responsibility of member states, EU policies, such as the free movement of workers, have significantly impacted sport (e.g., the Bosman ruling), and the Treaty of Lisbon requires considering the specific nature of sport when applying economic rules. The segment also introduces the EU's symbols, noting that the flag of Europe, featuring 12 golden stars on a blue background, was originally designed for the Council of Europe in 1955 and adopted by the European Communities in 1986.]

Sport
Main article: Sport policies of the European Union
Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. There are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU member state citizenship.[288] The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.[289] This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.[290] The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.[291]

[Summary: This segment details the official symbols of the European Union, explaining that the 12 stars on the flag symbolize the peoples of Europe and represent perfection and entirety. It notes that the motto, "United in Diversity," was adopted in 2000, and the EU's anthem is the instrumental prelude to Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," adopted in 1985. Furthermore, the mythological figure Europa and the bull serve as recurring symbols, decorating EU institutions and appearing on euro banknotes and residence permit cards.]

Against the blue sky of the Western world, the stars symbolise the peoples of Europe in a form of a circle, the sign of union. The number of stars is invariably twelve, the figure twelve being the symbol of perfection and entirety.

—	Council of Europe. Paris, 7–9 December 1955.
United in Diversity was adopted as the motto of the union in 2000, having been selected from proposals submitted by school pupils.[294] Since 1985, the flag day of the union has been Europe Day, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 Schuman declaration). The anthem of the EU is an instrumental version of the prelude to the Ode to Joy, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions.[295] Besides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the EU's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of euro banknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.[296]

Economically, the EU has had a significant positive effect; a 2019 study suggested that without European integration, per capita incomes for member states joining between 1973 and 2004 would have been about 10% lower in their first decade of membership.]

The majority of media in the European Union are national-orientated, although some EU-wide media focusing on European affairs have emerged since the early 1990s, such as Euronews, Eurosport, EUobserver, EURACTIV or Politico Europe.[304][305] Arte is a public Franco-German TV network that promotes programming in the areas of culture and the arts. 80 per cent of its programming are provided in equal proportion by the two member companies, while the remainder is being provided by the European Economic Interest Grouping ARTE GEIE and the channel's European partners.[306] The MEDIA Programme of the European Union has supported the European popular film and audiovisual industries since 1991. It provides support for the development, promotion and distribution of European works within Europe and beyond.[307]

The European Union has had a significant positive economic effect on most member states.[308] According to a 2019 study of the member states who joined from 1973 to 2004, "without European integration, per capita incomes would have been, on average, approximately 10% lower in the first ten years after joining the EU".[308]

[Summary: Analysis of the EU's influence shows mixed economic results, noting Greece as an exception prior to 2008, while a 2021 study confirmed the 2004 enlargement benefited all groups, especially unskilled labor in new member states. The EU is widely credited with promoting peace and anchoring democracy in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the USSR. However, critics argue that the EU's reluctance to intervene and provision of funds can inadvertently benefit leaders overseeing democratic backsliding, though Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union may constrain electoral autocracies like Hungary.]

Greece was the exception reported by the study, which analysed up to 2008, "to avoid confounding effects from the global financial crisis".[308] A 2021 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that the 2004 enlargement had aggregate beneficial economic effects on all groups in both the old and new member states. The largest winners were the new member states, in particular unskilled labour in the new member states.[309]

The European Union is frequently cited as having made a major contribution to peace in Europe, in particular by pacifying border disputes,[310][311] and to the spread of democracy, especially by encouraging democratic reforms in aspiring Eastern European member states after the collapse of the USSR.[312][313] Scholar Thomas Risse wrote in 2009, "there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that the EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new democracies."[313] However, R. Daniel Kelemen argues that the EU has proved beneficial to leaders who are overseeing democratic backsliding, as the EU is reluctant to intervene in domestic politics, gives authoritarian governments funds which they can use to strengthen their regimes, and because freedom of movement within the EU allows dissenting citizens to leave their backsliding countries. At the same time, the union might provide through Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union an external constraint that prevents electoral autocracies, currently Hungary,[314] from progressing into closed autocracies.[315]
