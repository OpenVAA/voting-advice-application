[Summary: The European Court of Auditors (ECA) serves as the supreme audit institution of the European Union. Established in Luxembourg in 1975, it is recognized as one of the seven official EU institutions. The Court is composed of one member from each EU member state (currently 27), assisted by approximately 900 civil servants.]

The European Court of Auditors (ECA; French: Cour des comptes européenne) is the supreme audit institution of the European Union (EU). It was established in 1975 in Luxembourg and is one of the seven EU institutions.[1][2] The Court comprises one member from each EU member state (currently 27) supported by approximately 900 civil servants.This article is part of a series onPolitics of the European UnionMember states (27)Treaties and DeclarationsExecutive institutionsLegislative institutionsJudicial institutionsAuditory institutionsEuropean Central BankOther bodiesEuratomEconomic and Monetary UnionSchengen AreaEuropean Economic AreaElectionsLawPolicies and issuesForeign relationsDefunct bodiesflag European Union portalOther countriesvteSee also: History of the European Union


=== SEGMENT 2 ===
[Summary: The European Court of Auditors (ECA) was created by the 1975 Budgetary Treaty and formally established in October 1977, initially serving as an external body auditing the European Communities' finances and replacing two previous audit bodies. The ECA gained defined legal status as the fifth EU institution under the Treaty of Maastricht, which granted it new powers, such as the ability to bring actions before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Furthermore, the Treaty of Amsterdam expanded the ECA's authority to audit the finances of the whole of the European Union.]

The ECA was created by the 1975 Budgetary Treaty and was formally established on 18 October 1977, holding its first session a week later. At that time the ECA was not a formal institution; it was an external body designed to audit the finances of the European Communities. It replaced two separate audit bodies, one which dealt with the finances of the European Economic Community and Euratom, and one which dealt with the European Coal and Steel Community.[3]The ECA did not have a defined legal status until the Treaty of Maastricht when it was made the fifth institution, the first new institution since the founding of the Community. By becoming an institution it gained some new powers, such as the ability to bring actions before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). At first its audit power related only to the European Community pillar of the European Union (EU), but under the Treaty of Amsterdam it gained the full power to audit the finances of the whole of the EU.[3]Functions


=== SEGMENT 3 ===
[Summary: Despite its name, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is an external investigatory audit agency rather than a judicial body. Its primary role is to ensure the EU budget is implemented correctly and that funds are spent legally and with sound management, which it achieves by checking paperwork and conducting spot checks. The ECA reports its findings to EU institutions and Member States, and its decisions form the basis for actions taken by the European Commission, such as suspending funds in regions where management issues are identified.]

Despite its name, the ECA has no jurisdictional functions. It is rather a professional external investigatory audit agency.[4] The primary role of the ECA is to externally check if the budget of the European Union has been implemented correctly and that EU funds have been spent legally and with sound management. In doing so, the ECA checks the paperwork of all persons handling any income or expenditure of the Union and carries out spot checks. The ECA is bound to report any problems in its reports for the attention of the EU's Member States and institutions, these reports include its general and specific annual reports, as well as special reports on its performance audits.[5][6] The ECA's decision is the basis for the European Commission decisions; for example, when the ECA found problems in the management of EU funds in the regions of England, the Commission suspended funds to those regions and is prepared to fine those who do not return to acceptable standards.[7]


=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: The European Court of Auditors (ECA) maintains independence while interacting closely with other EU institutions, primarily by presenting its annual report to the European Parliament. This report is crucial, as the Parliament uses it to decide whether to approve the European Commission's budget management, a process that historically led to the 1999 resignation of the Santer Commission. Additionally, the ECA provides assurances on the proper use of taxpayer money and must be consulted on financial legislation, though its opinions are not binding.]

In this role, the ECA has to remain independent yet remain in touch with the other institutions; for example, a key role is the presentation of the ECA's annual report to the European Parliament. It is based on this report that the Parliament makes its decision on whether or not to sign off the European Commission's handling of the budget for that year.[5] The Parliament notably refused to do this in 1984 and 1999, the latter case forced the resignation of the Santer Commission.[8] The ECA, if satisfied, also sends assurances to the Council and Parliament that the taxpayers' money is being properly used,[5] and the ECA must be consulted before the adoption of any legislation with financial implications, but its opinion is never binding.[9]Organisation


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: Members of the European Court of Auditors (ECA) are nominated by each EU Member State and formally appointed by the Council of the European Union following consultation with the European Parliament. They serve renewable six-year terms, which are staggered to maintain continuity. Appointees must be highly qualified individuals from national audit bodies whose independence is unquestionable, and they are prohibited from engaging in other professional activities during their service.]

Each EU Member State nominates a candidate to serve as an ECA Member. Members are formally appointed by the Council of the European Union after consultation with the European Parliament. They are appointed for a renewable term of six years. They are not all replaced every six years, however, as their terms do not coincide (four of the original members began with reduced terms of four years for this reason).[10] Members are chosen from people who have served in national audit bodies, who are qualified for the office and whose independence is beyond doubt. While serving in the Court, members cannot engage in any other professional activities.[11]


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: The independent European Court of Auditors (ECA) members determine their own organization and rules of procedure, which must be ratified by the Council of the European Union. Structurally, the ECA, since the Treaty of Nice, can establish chambers; it currently operates with five audit chambers, each having specific responsibilities. Individual members lead audits, manage the internal adoption process for reports, and are responsible for presenting the final adopted reports to institutional stakeholders and the media.]

As the body is independent, its members are free to decide their own organisation and rules of procedure, although these must be ratified by the Council of the European Union.[12] Since the Treaty of Nice, the ECA can set up "chambers"[13] (with only a few Members each) to adopt certain types of reports or opinions. It is currently composed of five audit chambers, each of which has specific areas of responsibility. Members are responsible for leading audits and guiding reports through the internal adoption procedure. When a report has been adopted, the reporting member presents it to the institutional stakeholders such as the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, and to the media.


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is supported by a staff of approximately 800, including auditors, translators, and administrators recruited through the European Civil Service. ECA auditors inspect EU institutions and national authorities managing EU funds, noting that 90% of EU expenditure is managed nationally. Lacking legal powers, the ECA informs the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) upon finding a fault, while the Secretary-General handles administrative duties and ensures the publication of reports in the Official Journal.]

The ECA is supported by a staff of approximately 800 auditors, translators and administrators recruited as part of the European Civil Service. Auditors are divided into auditor groups which inspect and prepare draft reports for the ECA to take decisions upon. Inspections take place not only of EU institutions but of any state which receives EU funds, given that 90% of income and expenditure is managed by national authorities rather than the EU. Upon finding a fault, the ECA—possessing no legal powers of its own—informs the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which is the EU's anti-fraud agency.[5] The ECA is also assisted by the Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, elected by the College of ECA Members, who—along with general management and assistance to the President—draws up draft minutes and keeps archives of decisions, as well as ensuring the publication of reports in the Official Journal of the European Union.[14]President


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: The President of the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is elected by the members via a secret ballot for a renewable three-year term. The President is responsible for convening and chairing meetings, ensuring decisions are implemented, managing departments, and representing the institution. The current President is Tony Murphy (Ireland), who took office on October 1, 2022, succeeding Klaus-Heiner Lehne (Germany).]

The members then elect one of their members as the President of the ECA for a renewable three-year term. The election takes place by a secret ballot of those members who applied for the presidency. The duties of the President (which may be delegated) are to convene and chair the meetings of the ECA, ensuring that decisions are implemented and the departments (and other activities) are soundly managed. The President also represents the institution and appoints a representative for it in contentious proceedings.[14]The current President is Tony Murphy (from Ireland) who took office on October 1, 2022. He succeeded Klaus-Heiner Lehne (Germany), elected in 2016. The previous presidents were Sir Norman Price (elected in 1977, United Kingdom), Michael Murphy (1977, Ireland), Pierre Lelong (1981, France), Marcel Mart (1984, Luxembourg), Aldo Angioi (1990, Italy), André Middelhoek (1992, Netherlands), Bernhard Friedmann (1996, Germany), Jan O.

[Summary: The European Court of Auditors (ECA) publishes its audit results through various reports (annual, special) and reviews, making them available online in all official EU languages; for example, 93 reports were published in 2017. A key area of criticism concerns the Statement of Assurance (SoA), required since 1994, where minor accounting omissions necessitate refusing assurance for the entire annual budget, even if most of the budget is considered reliable.]

ted (€1600/month) or non-remunerated.

Work
The ECA publishes the results of its audit work in a variety of reports – annual reports, specific annual reports and special reports – depending on the type of audit. Other published products include opinions and review-based publications. In total, the ECA published 93 reports in 2017. All reports, opinions and reviews are published on the ECA's website in the official EU languages.

Criticism
Statement of assurance
Since 1994 the ECA has been required to provide a "statement of assurance", essentially a certificate that an entire annual budget can be accounted for. This has proved to be a problem, as even relatively minor omissions require the ECA to refuse a statement of assurance for the entire budget, even if almost all of the budget is considered reliable.[citation needed]


=== SEGMENT 13 ===
[Summary: Strict auditing requirements, which often flag paperwork errors even when spending is legal, have led to media reports claiming EU accounts are "riddled with fraud," drawing criticism towards the auditing system. The European Commission has pushed back, arguing the standard is too high and stating that only 0.09% of the budget is subject to fraud, emphasizing the need to distinguish fraud from other irregularities. Additionally, the controversial 2003 dismissal of Marta Andreasen, who criticized procedures in 2002, has raised doubts about the integrity of the institutions.]

This has led to media reports of the EU accounts being "riddled with fraud", where issues are based on errors in paperwork even though the underlying spending was legal.[citation needed] The auditing system itself has drawn criticism from this perception. The Commission in particular has stated that the bar is too high, and that only 0.09% of the budget is subject to fraud.[17] The Commission has elsewhere stated that it is important to distinguish between fraud and other irregularities.[18] The controversial dismissal in 2003 of Marta Andreasen for her criticism of procedures in 2002 has, for some, called into doubt the integrity of the institutions.


=== SEGMENT 14 ===
[Summary: The certification of EU annual accounts is a contentious issue; while it is frequently claimed that accounts have not been certified since 1994, the European Commission asserts that every budget since 2007 has been signed off. The Court of Auditors' 2009 report specifically noted that the two biggest areas of the budget, agriculture and regional spending, remained "materially affected by error." Critics, including former MEP Terry Wynn, argue that the EU's auditing standards, which focus on the legality and regularity of transactions, are impossibly high for the Commission to meet, contrasting sharply with the US system which focuses primarily on financial information.]

It is frequently claimed that annual accounts have not been certified by the external auditor since 1994. In its annual report on the implementation of the 2009 EU Budget, the Court of Auditors found that the two biggest areas of the EU budget, agriculture and regional spending, have not been signed off on and remain "materially affected by error".[19] Nonetheless, the European Commission claims that every budget since 2007 has been signed off.[20]

Terry Wynn, an MEP who served on the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and reached the position of chairman, has also backed these calls, stating that it is impossible for the Commission to achieve these standards. In a report entitled EU Budget – Public Perception & Fact – how much does it cost, where does the money go and why is it criticised so much?, Wynn cites consensus that practice in the EU differs from that in the US. In the US, the focus is on the financial information, not on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, 'So, other than in Europe, the political reaction in the US to the failure to obtain a clean audit opinion is only "a big yawn"'.[21]


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: The segment contrasts the UK's audit system, where qualifying 13 out of 500 accounts does not invalidate the whole budget, with the potential implications of applying EU standards, which might necessitate qualifying the entire British central government expenditure. Furthermore, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) clarified that while Member States are responsible for the legality and regularity of spending on Cohesion Policies, the European Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the correct implementation of the budget, citing Article 274 of the Treaty.]

By comparison, the Comptroller and Auditor General for the United Kingdom stated that there were 500 separate accounts for the UK, and "in the last year, I qualified 13 of the 500. If I had to operate the EU system, then, because I qualify 13 accounts, I might have to qualify the whole British central government expenditure". Despite the problems, the Barroso Commission stated that it aimed to bring the budget within the Court's limits by the end of its mandate in 2009.[17]

The ECA made clear in its year report for 2010 that "Responsibility for the legality and regularity of spending on Cohesion Policies starts in the Member States, but the Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the correct implementation of the budget". In previous reports, the ECA has noted that "Regardless of the method of implementation applied, the Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts of the European Communities (Article 274 of the Treaty)".[19]


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: The size of the European Court of Auditors (ECA) has been criticized because its one-member-per-state system caused the College of Members to grow significantly, reaching 28 members by 2013. This expansion made achieving consensus difficult, leading to a reduction in the number of special reports published annually (from fifteen to six between 2003 and 2005), despite an increase in staff. Although proposals existed to reduce the ECA's size, neither the European Constitution nor the Treaty of Lisbon implemented changes to its composition.]

Size
The size of the ECA has also come under criticism. Owing to the one-member-per-state system, its College of Members grew from nine to twenty-eight as of 2013 (twenty-seven after completing of the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union/Brexit on 31 January 2020[22][23]). Attempting to get consensus in the body has thus become more difficult; this led to the number of its special reports per year shrinking from fifteen to six between 2003 and 2005, despite its staff growing by 200 over the same period. Some proposals have been for its size to be reduced to five members or just one, possibly with an advisory board with members from each member state. However, neither the European Constitution nor the Treaty of Lisbon proposed any changes to its composition, despite calls by former ECA members and MEPs to embrace change.[4][24]
