# Foreword

The Memos to the European Union leadership have been a Bruegel tradition since 2009. Every five years – after the European elections but before a new European Commission takes office – we take stock of the state of affairs of policies related to EU economic prosperity, reflect on the main challenges facing the EU and make recommendations on how the new EU leadership should address them. Except for the two opening memos – one to the Presidents of the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, the other to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Commission Vice President – the memos are addressed to incoming commissioners responsible for specific policy areas. As Commission portfolios relevant to economic prosperity have grown in scope, so have our memos. This edition covers 18 individual policy areas in addition to the two flagship memos, up from 11 in 2009 and 2014, and 14 in 2019.


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: The Bruegel memos, published every five years following European Parliament elections, have consistently coincided with major turning points in the EU economy over the last 15 years. The text details the specific economic contexts for the 2009 (post-global financial crisis) and 2014 (post-crisis recovery with high unemployment) editions. The 2019 memos were written when the EU faced new structural challenges, such as geopolitical tensions and the green transition, prompting the recommendation for policymakers to be ‘braver, greener, fairer’.]

By coincidence, each election to the European Parliament in the last 15 years – and hence each edition of our memos – was roughly aligned with a turning point in the EU economy. The 2009 memos were written after the global financial crisis had hit Europe with full force, but before the onset of the euro debt crisis (a risk that we clearly flagged). In 2014, the crisis had been overcome, but unemployment remained high, banking systems weak and Economic and Monetary Union governance reforms were a work in progress. Five years later, the EU had succeeded in significantly reducing unemployment and lowering the risk of renewed financial instability. But the challenge of invigorating medium-term growth remained and the EU was confronted with new challenges: mounting geopolitical tensions, the need to accelerate the green transition and the social consequence of digital transformation. Accordingly, our 2019 memos implored EU policymakers to be ‘braver, greener, fairer’.


=== SEGMENT 9 ===
[Summary: During the past five years, the EU faced two major crises: COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. Economically, these crises were managed better than the 2010-2012 crises, evidenced by the launch of NextGenerationEU in 2020 and joint gas procurement in 2022 following Russian supply cuts. Despite these successful interventions, the EU economy is currently recovering slowly, and medium-term growth prospects remain weak.]

During the past five years, the EU has faced two unprecedented economic and political crises: COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, a European country bordering four EU member states. From an economic perspective, these two crises were much better managed than the crises of 2010-2012. Weeks after the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the EU initiated NextGenerationEU, a groundbreaking temporary recovery instrument. And in 2022, shortly after gas supplies from Russia were cut, the EU was able to organise itself partly by jointly procuring gas from alternative sources. Yet, like in 2014, the EU economy is recovering too slowly and medium-term growth prospects remain weak.


=== SEGMENT 10 ===
[Summary: The EU is currently grappling with long-term challenges—including growth, geopolitics, and the green transition—that existed even before the recent crises, reflected by the overlap in Commission President Von der Leyen's 2019 and 2024 political guidelines. However, the conditions for tackling these issues are now significantly more adverse, marked by acute geopolitical threats, a less dependable United States, and entrenched economic nationalism. Internal difficulties, such as shrinking fiscal space, the acute effects of climate change, and the rise of political extremes, further complicate the EU's ability to chart a way forward.]

Many of the problems we face today reflect a return to longer-term challenges that were already visible before the latest string of crises: growth, geopolitics, green transition, social cohesion. It is not surprising that Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s political guidelines, issued before her re-appointment in July 2024, overlap to a significant degree with her 2019 political guidelines. But the external and internal conditions under which the EU needs to tackle these long-term challenges are significantly more adverse than they were in 2019. Geopolitical threats are much more acute, with a direct security threat at the borders of the EU in the context of a less-dependable United States, and a more aggressive and authoritarian China. Economic nationalism has become entrenched, threatening the multilateral order. Higher energy prices have hurt growth and competitiveness. Fiscal needs have grown, but fiscal space has shrunk. The effects of climate change have become acute, but the pace of emissions reductions is far too slow, particularly outside the EU. Parties representing political extremes have gained support at both national and EU levels, making it harder to chart a way forward.


=== SEGMENT 11 ===
[Summary: The EU faces three core challenges: uniting member states, defending against external threats and internal value corrosion, and achieving growth, including successful enlargement. General policy recommendations emphasize avoiding nationalism, maintaining multilateralism, openness, and competition as cornerstones of prosperity, and assigning greater priority to national and economic security.]

This darker backdrop is reflected in the title of our memos. Today’s challenges are, first, to unite EU countries and citizens behind a shared agenda. Second, to defend the EU from external threats and EU values from corrosion. Third, to grow: in economic terms, but also in the sense of successful enlargement to new members.

What policy recommendations follow? The answer depends on each policy area, but it is possible to identify a few general themes. First, the EU should not jump on the nationalist bandwagon (even collectively). Multilateralism, openness and competition remain cornerstones of EU prosperity and essential to its credibility in the world. Second, the EU cannot be naïve: it must assign much greater priority to both national and economic security. Support for Ukraine remains a top pri


=== SEGMENT 12 ===
[Summary: The EU must prioritize higher investment in defense and significantly improve the single market, noting that single market improvements, especially creating a single market for defense production that includes the UK, create no trade-off between growth and security. Furthermore, the EU must persevere with the European Green Deal while protecting industrial competitiveness and vulnerable groups. Finally, the EU needs to dedicate greater resources to partnerships with developing countries, focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals and accelerating emissions mitigation.]

ority, as does higher investment in defence. Third, improving the single market is even more important than in the past: it is one of the few things that the EU can do that creates no trade-off between growth and security. This includes the creation of a single market for defence production – which should include the United Kingdom. Fourth, the EU must persevere with its European Green Deal. But this can only succeed if it preserves industrial competitiveness and ensures that vulnerable groups are protected. Fifth, the EU must pay far greater attention and devote more resources to partnerships with developing countries, focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals and including the provision of help to those countries to accelerate emissions mitigation.


=== SEGMENT 13 ===
[Summary: The EU must adopt a creative and bold approach, described as 'braver' than in 2019, to address overwhelming needs while public resources remain scarce, necessitating that it 'do more with less.' This requires challenging political red lines to deepen the single market in critical areas like energy, defense, and capital markets, and increasing EU-level financing for public goods to reconcile investment needs with fiscal consolidation. Additionally, the EU must devise creative industrial policies that avoid fragmenting the single market or weakening the rules-based international system.]

Most important, the EU must be creative and bold: in this sense, ‘braver’ applies to this edition of the memos even more than to the 2019 edition. It must do more with less: the needs are overwhelming and public resources are scarce. This implies that political red lines preventing coordination and single market deepening must be challenged when the efficiency gains from doing so are high (as in energy policy, the digital economy, services trade, defence and capital markets). Closing public investment gaps in European public goods cannot be reconciled with fiscal consolidation unless a greater share of investment is undertaken and financed at EU level. And the EU must find creative ways to conduct industrial policy that do not fragment the single market or weaken the rules-based international system. In these and other areas, the memos offer specific recommendations.


=== SEGMENT 14 ===
[Summary: This segment introduces the collection of 20 self-contained memos, clarifying that the opinions expressed are those of the individual authors, not an institutional view of Bruegel. The consistency and clarity of the arguments are largely credited to the extensive editorial oversight provided by Stephen Gardner, Bruegel’s long-serving editor. The specific memo is authored by Maria Demertzis, André Sapir, and Jeromin Zettelmeyer, and is dated September 1, 2024, addressed to the Presidents of the European Commission, Council, and Parliament.]

As in previous editions, each memo is self-contained. The opinions expressed are those of the authors of each memo: Bruegel does not have an institutional view. Readers may nonetheless find the arguments and recommendations broadly consistent and coherent. This reflects extensive discussions among authors and across memos; a review process overseen by Katja Knezevic, Bruegel’s head of communication, and ourselves; and – most importantly – the steady hand and discipline imposed by Stephen Gardner, Bruegel’s indispensable, long-serving editor. To the extent that our 20 memos have a consistent style and clarity of argument, it is his achievement.Maria Demertzis, André Sapir and Jeromin ZettelmeyerBrussels, 1 September 2024---# Memo to the Presidents of the European Commission, Council and Parliament**Maria Demertzis, André Sapir and Jeromin Zettelmeyer**


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: The EU faces substantial challenges characterized by squeezed fiscal space due to the pandemic and energy support measures, eroded industrial competitiveness, and a widening productivity and per-capita income gap with the United States. The leadership must simultaneously support Ukraine, reinvigorate growth, meet ambitious 2030 and 2040 climate targets, restore social cohesion, improve external security, and enhance EU governance without creating further division.]

The pandemic recession and energy-support measures have squeezed fiscal space. European Union industrial competitiveness has been eroded. The productivity and per-capita income gap with the United States has widened. Meanwhile, the world around the EU has become more threatening and fragmented.In the face of all this, the challenges confronting you are substantial. You must continue to support Ukraine while implementing measures to reinvigorate EU growth, meet the 2030 climate targets and lay the ground for meeting the 2040 goals, and secure faster emissions reductions beyond the EU’s borders. Social cohesion needs to be restored to head off threats to the EU model. More needs to be done to improve EU external security. Underpinning all of this, a serious effort must be made to improve EU governance – and it must be done without creating further division.- Continue to support Ukraine- Lay the groundwork for meeting the 2040 climate goals- Defend competition, openness and multilateralism## State of affairs


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: Over the last five years, the European Union successfully navigated unprecedented crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the sharpest economic downturn since the Great Depression, and energy price spikes caused by Russia's war on Ukraine, while preserving European solidarity. Measures like NextGenerationEU funds and coordinated energy policies mitigated catastrophic outcomes, and assistance to Ukraine supported its resistance. Additionally, Ukraine, Moldova, and Bosnia and Herzegovina obtained EU candidate status and were invited to start membership negotiations.]

In the last five years, the European Union managed to find a way through unprecedented crises: a global pandemic, leading to the sharpest economic downturn since the Great Depression; a massive spike in energy prices, caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine; and a sharp rise in inflation. Team Europe by and large rose to the challenge and European solidarity was preserved.The NextGenerationEU (NGEU) funds, temporary EU unemployment insurance and prefinancing of vaccine purchases prevented human and economic catastrophe during the pandemic. A coordinated reduction in energy demand and the commitment to keep energy markets open prevented gas shortages during the winter of 2022-23. Economic and military assistance to Ukraine helped beat back Russia’s initial assault, and remains essential to Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine, Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina obtained EU candidate status and were invited to start membership negotiations.


=== SEGMENT 17 ===
[Summary: The recent crises have left the EU bruised, suffering a large and persistent terms-of-trade shock from higher energy prices, unlike the United States. Although the EU avoided a second recession, the resulting erosion of industrial competitiveness is expected to widen the productivity and per-capita income gap with the US. Furthermore, the global environment has become more threatening and fragmented, highlighted by the precarious military situation in Ukraine.]

However, these crises have left the EU in a bruised state. Unlike the United States, the EU suffered a large and persistent terms of-trade shock in the form of higher energy prices. While the EU managed to avoid a second recession, the erosion of industrial competitiveness is expected to lead to lower medium-term growth in Europe’s industrial heartland. Some of this slowdown will be offset by higher growth in Europe’s south and southeast thanks to greater energy diversification, abundant solar energy and the beneficial impact of their EU-funded recovery and resilience plans. The net effect, however, is a widening productivity and per-capita income gap with the United States.Meanwhile, the world around the EU has become more threatening and fragmented. The military situation in Ukraine remains precarious.


=== SEGMENT 18 ===
[Summary: The EU faces a more threatening global landscape characterized by China's increased authoritarianism and economic coercion, alongside continued US protectionism. The potential return of Donald Trump threatens to end US support for Ukraine and joint US-EU action, requiring the EU to strengthen its own defensive capabilities. While the EU's overall debt ratio has decreased since 2020, high deficits in several member states prompted the European Commission in June 2024 to recommend opening excessive deficit procedures for seven countries, in addition to Romania.]

China has become both more authoritarian and more assertive, engaging in economic coercion against the EU and its allies. The US shift toward protectionism, initiated by President Trump, has continued under President Biden. Donald Trump’s return to the White House could spell the end of US support for Ukraine and joint US-EU action against Putin, and may lead to new tariffs and other hostile US actions against the EU. Even if Trump does not return, US support for Ukraine and its engagement in Europe is likely to diminish, requiring the EU to fill the gap, strengthen its defensive capability and defend its interests and values more vigorously.> The world around the EU has become more threatening and fragmentedThe pandemic recession and energy-support measures have squeezed, but not eliminated, the EU’s fiscal space. The public debt ratio jumped by over 12 points of EU GDP in 2020, but has since come down by almost 9 points, reflecting the economic recovery and the surprise burst in inflation. More worrying than the level of debt per se is the fact that deficits remain high in many high-debt countries. In June 2024, the European Commission announced it would recommend opening excessive deficit procedures for Belgium, France, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia (in addition to Romania, which has been in the procedure since 2021).


=== SEGMENT 19 ===
[Summary: The EU faces a critical dilemma where the urgency for climate action has increased significantly due to rapidly felt climate change effects and persistently high global emissions, which depleted an estimated 11% of the 1.5°C carbon budget in 2023 alone. Simultaneously, the political space for implementing climate measures has shrunk, evidenced by the significant gains made by climate-skeptic parties in the European Parliament elections, reflecting widening political and social polarization across the bloc.]

At the same time, the EU has lost both ‘climate space’ – making climate action more urgent – and political space for climate action. Though EU emissions have been on a declining trend for about 15 years, worldwide emissions remain high and rising. Emissions in 2023 alone may have depleted 11 percent of the remaining global carbon budget consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels (Liu et al, 2024). The effects of climate change are being felt faster and more violently than expected, as the floods, droughts and wildfires of 2023 showed. Yet, parties opposed to climate measures and EU-level action made significant gains in the European Parliament elections. This reflects widening political and social polarisation, including in the largest EU economies.> Climate action has become more urgent while the political space for it has shrunk


=== SEGMENT 20 ===
[Summary: During the previous legislative cycle, the EU enacted several landmark laws across key areas. These included the Recovery and Resiliency Facility (February 2021) financed by common borrowing, the European Climate Law (June 2021), and significant digital legislation such as the Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, and Artificial Intelligence Act. The EU also prioritized economic security (e.g., European Chips Act, Anti-Coercion Instrument) and achieved hard-fought compromises on the 2024 Migration and Asylum package and the revamp of European fiscal rules.]

The EU passed several landmark laws in the previous cycle. These include the Recovery and Resiliency Facility financed by common borrowing (February 2021), the European Climate Law (June 2021) and a set of digital laws (the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in 2022; the Artificial Intelligence Act in 2023). Economic security took centre stage (the European Chips Act, Critical Raw Materials Act and Anti-Coercion Instrument in 2023; the 2024 Cyber Resilience Act). The 2024 Migration and Asylum package and the 2024 revamp of the European fiscal rules represented hard-fought compromises and are for the most part improvements.


=== SEGMENT 21 ===
[Summary: Not all recent EU legislation has been successful, with some regulations, like the Farm-to-Fork Strategy, being rushed without proper impact assessment, leading to high compliance burdens. Progress has stalled in critical areas, including the Council failing to agree on new own resources for NGEU repayment and minimal advancement on the Banking Union and Capital Markets Union (CMU). The Commission's response to declining competitiveness was deemed lopsided, focusing on industrial policy (Net Zero Industry Act) while failing to deepen the single market, though the CMU debate has recently been revitalized.]

But not all new legislation has been good, and progress has been slow or absent in important areas:-   Some regulation has been rushed out without proper impact assessment, resulting in high compliance burdens and/or high profile failures (such as the Farm-to-Fork Strategy). Despite the European Commission’s efforts, the quality of ex-post evaluation remains poor.-   The Council failed to agree on new own resources to help repay NGEU borrowing, notwithstanding good proposals from the Commission in 2021 and 2023 and their endorsement by the European Parliament.-   The Commission’s response to declining EU competitiveness has been lopsided: while it attempted to expand EU-level industrial policy (the 2024 Net Zero Industry Act), it has not succeeded in passing major legislation to deepen the single market.-   There has been no progress on banking union and only small steps on capital markets union (CMU).This said, the single market debate has been invigorated by the publication of the Letta Report on the Single Market (Letta, 2024), European Central Bank calls to accelerate CMU and the return of CMU to the Council agenda in 2024.


=== SEGMENT 22 ===
[Summary: The text identifies two primary challenges facing the EU: providing effective support to Ukraine and invigorating economic growth. Supporting Ukraine in its existential war against Russia is deemed the most urgent challenge, as a defeat would be a major humanitarian, political, and security catastrophe for the EU. Economic growth is hampered by factors including high energy prices, skills shortages, declining working-age population, and sluggish investment, which are widening the growth gap between 'advanced Europe' and the United States.]

## Challenges**Provide effective support to Ukraine**The most urgent challenge is to support Ukraine in its existential war against Russia. A Ukrainian defeat would be a humanitarian and political catastrophe and a blow to the EU’s security.**Invigorate growth**High energy prices, a declining working-age population, skills shortages, sluggish private and public investment, insufficient exit of inefficient firms and slow adoption of digital technology are exacerbating the long-standing growth differentials between ‘advanced Europe’ and the United States (‘emerging Europe’ – the central and eastern EU members – are


=== SEGMENT 23 ===
[Summary: The analyzed challenges facing the EU include managing regional growth, achieving climate goals, and restoring social cohesion. Central and eastern EU members are projected to grow significantly faster than the EU average, continuing their convergence with richer countries. Meeting the 2030 and 2040 climate targets is complicated by sluggish growth, political backlash, and reduced fiscal space, necessitating that the EU also accelerate emissions reductions in emerging markets and address internal political polarization.]

 projected to grow much faster, at about twice the EU average, and to continue converging with richer EU countries).

**Meet the 2030 climate targets and lay the ground for meeting the 2040 goals**
Following through on the European Green Deal is more important than ever, but it will be difficult in light of sluggish growth, political backlash against the costs of climate action and reduced fiscal space.

> Following through on the European Green Deal is more important than ever

**Accelerate climate action outside the EU’s borders**
A successful European Green Deal is necessary but not sufficient for curbing climate change. The EU needs to devote much greater energy (and resources) to accelerating emissions reductions outside its borders, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies, where emissions are continuing to rise.

**Restore social cohesion**
Greater political and social polarisation in the EU threatens not only the Green Deal but potentially the entire European project. Addressing this at EU level is, however, challenging because most of these divisions are happening within member states rather than across member states.


=== SEGMENT 24 ===
[Summary: The EU must focus on two critical areas: improving external security and reforming internal governance. External security requires boosting defense capabilities, protecting critical infrastructure (including cyber), and reducing vulnerability to economic coercion from actors like China and potentially the US. Internally, the EU needs to address governance issues by reducing the power of vetoes resulting from unanimity requirements, which currently impede decisive action, future enlargement, and essential security support, such as aid to Ukraine.]

**Improve the EU’s external security**
In a structurally more dangerous world, the EU must boost its defence capabilities and do more to protect critical infrastructure, including cyber-infrastructure. It must also reduce its vulnerability to trade disruptions and acts of economic coercion, both from China and (given the potential return of President Trump) from the US.

**Improve EU governance**
Too many EU decisions require unanimity, giving vetoes to countries that attempt to free ride on the rest of the EU or where governments do not fully share the EU’s democratic values. With further enlargement, the EU will become even more diverse. Unless the power of potential holdouts is reduced, the EU will not be able to enlarge, nor will it be able to act decisively in areas essential to its security, including provision of support to Ukraine.


=== SEGMENT 25 ===
[Summary: Invigorating economic growth and reforming EU governance are crucial for addressing various challenges, but other objectives present difficult financial trade-offs. Supporting key initiatives like the Green Deal, Ukraine, and security requires substantial investment, leading to an estimated annual public and private investment gap of at least €356 billion for the climate transition and €125 billion for the digital transition up to 2030. Given tight fiscal space, raising new resources or agreeing to EU borrowing to cover these costs, plus rearmament and Ukraine reconstruction, will be difficult and divisive.]

Invigorating growth will help in dealing with all of these challenges. The same is true for reform of EU governance. For other objectives, however, you will face difficult trade-offs:

-   Supporting Ukraine, following through on the Green Deal, scaling-up international climate finance and improving security all cost money. Your services estimate that EU countries collectively face a total (public and private) annual investment gap of at least €356 billion for the climate transition and €125 billion for the digital transition, up to 2030. The gap is much larger if one also considers rearmament needs and the reconstruction of Ukraine. But fiscal space is tight, and raising own resources or agreeing to new EU borrowing will be difficult and divisive.


=== SEGMENT 26 ===
[Summary: The EU faces difficult trade-offs, as accelerating decarbonisation is projected to negatively impact short-term growth, especially after the Emissions Trading System (ETS) is extended to buildings and transportation (ETS2) in 2027, which will also strain social cohesion. While improving economic security and accelerating the green transition may require greater industrial and trade policy intervention, adopting protectionism or a hostile approach toward China risks undermining EU growth and hindering international climate action.]

-   Accelerating decarbonisation will have a negative impact on growth at least in the short term (in particular, after the emissions trading system (ETS) is extended to most areas of the economy, including buildings and transportation, in 2027 – known as ETS2). Higher and broader carbon pricing will further strain social cohesion and fan polarisation around climate action.
-   Improving the EU’s economic security and accelerating the green transition may require greater recourse to industrial policy and trade policy than in the past. But a ham-fisted approach that embraces protectionism and/or takes a hostile approach to China will hurt EU growth and make international climate action more difficult.

> Higher and broader carbon pricing will further strain social cohesion

You will need to choose policies that minimise these trade offs, bearing in mind not just their primary objective but also unintended consequences.


=== SEGMENT 27 ===
[Summary: The recommendations are guided by two common elements: maximizing results with limited resources and avoiding micromanagement of business and member states, which is seen as breeding opposition and impeding growth. To promote growth and cohesion, the document prioritizes deepening the single market, specifically through energy policy. This involves coordinating EU-wide investment in electricity infrastructure and creating a joint electricity market, viewing electrification as the best way to decarbonize without incurring a perpetual energy-cost disadvantage.]

## Recommendations

Our recommendations have two common elements: first, doing more with limited resources; second, avoiding micromanagement of business, member states and their key constituencies, which breeds opposition to European integration and can become an impediment to growth. We group our recommendations according to their main purpose.

**Promote growth and enhance cohesion**

**Deepen the single market in the areas of highest growth impact**

-   **Energy policy.** Electrification is Europe’s best bet to decarbonise without locking in a perpetual energy-cost disadvantage. EU-wide coordination of investment in electricity generation, transmission and storage and the creation of a joint electricity market will reduce the cost of electricity by exploiting geographic resource advantages, avoiding costly duplication and lowering capital costs.

[Summary: The recommendations propose deepening the single market by addressing skills shortages, which, alongside high energy costs, are identified as the primary impediment to EU investment. This requires reducing barriers to occupational mobility, reforming professional regulation, and improving social security coordination. Furthermore, advancing the Banking and Capital Markets Union necessitates consolidating banking crisis management under a strengthened Single Resolution Board and establishing a common, independent securities market supervisor.]

-   **Labour mobility and the internal market for services.** Together with high energy costs, skills shortages are the number one impediment to investment in the EU (EIB, 2023). To promote the efficient allocation of skills and services, barriers to occupational mobility must be reduced, by removing or reforming professional regulation that impedes mobility, extending automatic recognition of professional qualifications and improving the coordination of social security. The Letta report recommendations provide a good starting point (Letta, 2024).
-   **Banking and capital markets union.** Banking crisis management should be consolidated into a strengthened Single Resolution Board that integrates all national relevant entities and merges deposit guarantee systems. Banks that are highly reliant on national sovereigns (and vice versa) should be given regulatory incentives to diversify their sovereign exposures. A common and independent securities market supervisor would be a feasible and effective way to propel the capital markets union forwards.

=== SEGMENT 29 ===
[Summary: The analysis suggests that EU regulation must be made more growth-friendly by curbing regulatory excess, which often results from high compliance burdens or poor implementation. To achieve this, the EU should recommit to the 2016 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-making and the REFIT programme to reduce regulatory burdens. Furthermore, systematic impact assessments must be implemented, and ex-post evaluations should be conducted by an independent authority, such as the European Court of Auditors, to improve regulatory quality.]

**Curb regulatory excess and make EU regulation more growth-friendly**
Regulation can backfire if the compliance burdens are too high or implementation is poor.

-   Pressure to regulate too much or too early can come from all directions, including member states (pushing for replication of their legislation), the Commission (seeking to pre-empt inconsistent member-state legislation) or even business (seeking legal certainty). You need to be aware of these biases and push against them.
-   Recommit to the 2016 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-making and the ‘REFIT’ programme to reduce the regulatory burden. Impact assessment must be systematic, include assessment of delegated and implementing acts, and should be updated to account for major changes introduced in the legislative process. To improve quality, a more radical change is needed: ex-post evaluation should be carried out by an independent authority, such as the European Court of Auditors, which could have its remit extended.


=== SEGMENT 30 ===
[Summary: The analysis recommends that the implementation of recently enacted digital rules must stimulate competition, protect innovative start-ups, and minimize compliance costs for small firms, potentially requiring a single digital regulator. Additionally, the governance of EU-level innovation support needs improvement, specifically by strengthening the European Innovation Council (EIC) with an autonomous council of technology leaders. The EU should also extend its innovation support by creating a separate, mission-oriented pillar led by an independent institution modeled after the US Advanced Research Project Agencies (ARPA).]

-   Implement the digital rules enacted in the last five years in a way that stimulates competition among data-driven services, does not undermine innovative start-ups and minimises the cost of regulatory compliance, especially for small firms. This will require strong coordination of digital supervisory bodies and possibly the creation of a single digital regulator.

> Regulation can backfire if compliance burdens are too high or implementation is poor

**Improve the governance, mission and funding of EU-level innovation support**
The EU was right to create the European Innovation Council (EIC) to support ‘breakthrough innovation’ alongside its existing support for scientific research. But the EIC’s governance needs to be strengthened by establishing an autonomous council composed of recognised technology leaders responsible for project selection. EU innovation support should also be extended by a separate, mission-oriented pillar, led by an independent institution along the lines the US Advanced Research Project Agencies, which are able to take discretionary support decisions in pursuit of a politically-set mandate (Pinkus et al, 2024).


=== SEGMENT 31 ===
[Summary: The proposal suggests refocusing the EU budget primarily on European public goods, such as cross-border infrastructure, innovation support, and green investment. To fund these priorities, the share allocated to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) should be reduced by introducing co-funding by member states. Exploring a larger EU budget is also suggested, provided that major existing spending policies like CAP and cohesion are reformed.]

**Focus the EU budget on EU public goods**
The EU budget should be refocused on European public goods, including cross-border infrastructure, innovation support, green public investment in the EU, international climate finance and funding for international partnerships. To create the resources to fund these priorities, the share allocated to the Common Agricultural Policy should be reduced, by introducing co-funding by EU member states. Having a larger EU budget should also be explored, but only if current policies that absorb most of the EU budget funds (CAP and cohesion) are also reformed.


=== SEGMENT 32 ===
[Summary: The text proposes expanding the EU Blue Card program, the main instrument for employment-based immigration, to better attract skilled workers by making it a stepping stone to permanent residency. Proposed changes include granting automatic Blue Cards to foreign graduates and linking the system explicitly to member-state residency provisions. Furthermore, the segment stresses the necessity of defending competition, openness, and multilateralism, highlighting that competition enforcement and a rules-based trading system are vital for EU competitiveness and economic efficiency.]

**Expand the Blue Card programme and make it a stepping stone for permanent residency in the EU**
The EU’s main instrument for employment-based immigration, the Blue Card, has not succeeded in attracting more skilled workers to all of the EU. Recent reforms to the Blue Card Directive (2021) and the Single Permit Directive (2024) go the right way but are insufficient. Foreign nationals graduating from tertiary education or doing relevant professional training in the EU should receive an automatic EU Blue Card, enabling them to stay and work in the EU for at least one year beyond their study or training. Workers who have exhausted their Blue Card stay but otherwise satisfy all relevant criteria should have the option to remain resident and employed in the EU by creating explicit links between the Blue Card system and member-state provisions on permanent residency.

> The Blue Card has not succeeded in attracting more skilled workers to all of the EU

**Defend competition, openness and multilateralism**
Competition enforcement and state-aid rules remain essential for the exit of inefficient firms and to allow entry and growth of firms at the productivity frontier. A rules-based trading system remains essential to ensure access to exports market and to imported goods and services at lowest cost, including intermediate products and raw materials that are essential to EU competitiveness. Together with like-minded advanced economies including the United Kingdom, Japan, Canad

[Summary: The EU is urged to continue defending competition and multilateralism by working with partners like South Korea to keep world markets open, fight protectionism, and reform the WTO, especially concerning subsidies. Furthermore, the text addresses the Green Deal, noting that its goals will impose medium-term costs on European industrial competitiveness due to factors like the loss of free ETS allowances and ETS2 application. To ensure a fair transition, the EU must strengthen its clean tech advantage, better target the Just Transition Fund and Social Climate Fund to aid vulnerable groups, and transform the Common Agricultural Policy into a 'Rural Green Deal'.]

a and South Korea, the EU should continue to be a force to keep world markets open and fight protectionism. This requires defending and reforming World Trade Organisation rules, particularly their treatment of subsidies, and making the WTO more effective as an institution.

**Safeguarding the Green Deal and extending its global reach**

**Boost green industrialisation and establish a green social contract**
Green deal goals will have medium-term costs for European industrial competitiveness, particularly after the loss of free ETS allowances and, later, when ETS2 applies. This should be addressed by strengthening the EU’s comparative advantage in clean tech through instruments such as the mission-oriented innovation support proposed in the third recommendation, above.. A further obstacle to meeting Green Deal goals is the disproportionate burden of carbon pricing and regulation borne by vulnerable groups. To address this, the existing Just Transition Fund and Social Climate Fund must be better targeted to help those with lower incomes adjust to the energy transition, while the Common Agricultural Policy should be transformed into a ‘Rural Green Deal’ supporting farmers.

> Green deal goals will have medium term costs for European industrial competitiveness


=== SEGMENT 34 ===
[Summary: The EU is urged to stop treating international climate finance as development aid, recognizing it instead as a direct economic interest that is highly cost-effective for global decarbonization. The recommendation calls for the EU and G7 members to sponsor a joint initiative to scale up support for emission mitigation in emerging economies. This financial support should be conditional on agreed policies to phase out coal and must include grant funding for the social transitions of coal communities.]

**Scale-up international climate finance. The EU needs to stop thinking of international climate finance as a form of development aid**
Climate finance that meaningfully accelerates decarbonisation in emerging and developing economies is in the direct economic interest of the EU and other advanced countries, and is at least as cost-effective as money spent on decarbonisation within the EU. The EU and its G7 members should sponsor a G7-EU initiative to both scale-up and widen support for emission mitigation in emerging and developing economies. This should include sufficient grant funding to pay for the social transitions of coal communities, making financial support conditional on agreed policies to phase out coal (including domestic carbon pricing).


=== SEGMENT 35 ===
[Summary: The segment outlines strategies for strengthening EU security, focusing on robust support for Ukraine and enhancing EU defense autonomy. Recommendations include ensuring Ukraine receives sufficient fiscal and military hardware, potentially justifying common EU borrowing or prefinancing defense production, even if US support declines. Furthermore, the EU should create a single market for defense production and procurement and establish a temporary off-budget fund to accelerate rearmament efforts efficiently.]

**Strengthen the EU’s security**

**Support Ukraine and strengthen EU defence autonomy**

-   Do whatever it takes to ensure that Ukraine has both sufficient fiscal support and sufficient military hardware to defend itself, even if US support were to decline. Stopping Russia’s aggression would justify: 1) common EU borrowing; 2) prefinancing of (or purchase guarantees for) defence production (along the lines of prefinancing for the development of vaccines).
-   Create a single market for defence production and procurement. While the EU Treaty (Article 346) does not require such a single market, establishing it is allowed and will lower the cost of rearmament and increase the flexibility of arms supply.
-   Create a temporary off-budget EU fund to accelerate rearmament. This could be financed either by common borrowing or by member-state contributions. The allocations of funding (or arms purchased through common funding) should follow an efficiency logic – for example, with a higher share distributed to countries on the borders of the EU with higher levels of defence spending.


=== SEGMENT 36 ===
[Summary: The EU needs to address blind spots in its economic security strategy, which, despite commendable elements like the Anti-Coercion Instrument, risks focusing too much on past calamities (import disruptions) instead of future risks. These future risks include dependence through export concentration, asset expropriation, and financial weaponization. The EU should tackle these issues by cooperating with allies such as the UK and Japan, and by integrating security considerations into the single market agenda.]

**Address economic security blind spots**
While the Commission’s economic security strategy has been commendable – in particular, the creation of the Anti-Coercion Instrument – it risks being too focused on the calamities of the past (import disruptions) rather than the possible risks of the future (dependence through export and profit concentration, asset expropriations and financial weaponisation). The EU needs to address these risks in conjunction with like-minded allies, including the UK and Japan. It also needs to leverage the single market agenda with security in mind.

> The Commission’s economic security strategy risks being too focused on the calamities of the past


=== SEGMENT 37 ===
[Summary: The EU is advised to reset its relationship with the UK, acknowledging its importance for mutual security and economic stability. Closer cooperation is particularly recommended in defense, including common procurement and integrating the UK into the European single market for defense production, potentially via an intergovernmental treaty. Additionally, improvements to the existing Trade and Cooperation Agreement should focus on regulatory alignment and ensuring compatibility between the EU and UK carbon border adjustment mechanisms.]

**Reset the relationship with the UK**
The EU-UK relationship is important to both partners for security and economic reasons. A closer relationship should be sought particularly in defence – with a closer EU-UK relationship within NATO, to forestall and (if unavoidable) manage a reduction in US engagement – and common defence procurement. The development of a European single market in defence production should include the UK – if necessary, underpinned by an intergovernmental treaty. Improvements or extensions of the existing EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement should also be sought in areas such as regulatory alignment, and to ensure that there is no friction between the EU and UK carbon border adjustment mechanisms.


=== SEGMENT 38 ===
[Summary: The EU must urgently reform its decision-making and governance structures to prepare for the next wave of enlargement, which includes Ukraine's accession. Leaders should not avoid the divisive institutional debate, as current governance is already problematic, and pragmatic solutions like staged accession, enhanced cooperation, and treaty changes must be considered.]

**Reform EU decision-making both for greater efficiency and to prepare for enlargement**
The EU should be innovative in readying for the next wave of enlargement, including Ukraine’s accession. Staged accession should be considered seriously. It is unlikely that Ukraine or any other candidate country will join the EU during your term in office and you may be tempted to simply negotiate accession with candidate countries and ignore the reforms that the EU itself needs to implement to be able to function after the next enlargement. But this would be a huge mistake: EU decision-making and governance are problematic even today.

You should not be afraid to start the institutional debate because it is highly divisive. Neither enhanced cooperation nor even treaty changes should be off the table. At the same time, governance should not be an ideological exercise pitting pro- and anti-further EU integration against one another. It should be pragmatic. More integration may be needed in some areas, but not in others.

> The EU should be innovative in readying for the next wave of enlargement

[Summary: The segment first lists several recent references, including reports by the EIB and Enrico Letta, and a study on competitiveness requested by the European Parliament. It then introduces a memo to the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (HRVP), authored by Alicia García-Herrero, Heather Grabbe, and Jean Pisani-Ferry. The memo argues that the HRVP role was designed for a more stable, law-governed world, but the current EU is weaker, facing Russian aggression and prioritizing economic security, making external policy more crucial than ever.]

# Memo to the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy

**Alicia García-Herrero, Heather Grabbe and Jean Pisani-Ferry**

Your job was designed for a different world than the one the European Union now grapples with: a world built on principles and governed by law, in which the EU was a force of attraction because of its mass, prosperity and good governance. Today’s EU is weaker. It faces Russian aggression on its borders, while economic security has become a much bigger priority. In this context, the EU’s external policy is more important than ever.


=== SEGMENT 40 ===
[Summary: The memo asserts that the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (HRVP) role is constrained by a confusing institutional structure and must be adapted to a world dominated by intimidation and brute force. The authors propose that the HRVP should receive a stronger mandate, along with greater legal and financial capabilities, to coordinate common actions and address major challenges posed by global powers. This adaptation is necessary because the job was originally designed for a previous era where the EU was a force of attraction due to its mass and good governance.]

But your role is constrained by a confusing and contested institutional structure. A stark choice must be made on how to adapt your role to a world dominated by intimidation and brute force. The best option would be for you to have a stronger mandate to act on matters on which member states have decided to take common action. This would require greater legal and financial capabilities to coordinate relevant policies in the EU institutions.

- Confront the big challenges posed by China, Russia and the US
- Build new momentum with India and the Global South
- Better define the HRVP role

## State of affairs

The job of High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission (HRVP) was designed for a different world than the one Europe now grapples with: a world built on principles and governed by law, where the European Union was a force of attraction because of its mass, prosperity and good governance. Five years ago, few Europeans worried about their reliance on Russian energy and Chinese supply chains, and engagement in conflicts was largely a matter of choice.


=== SEGMENT 41 ===
[Summary: The EU is currently weaker and more vulnerable, facing external pressures like Russian aggression and having minimal influence in the Middle East conflict. Economic security has become a major priority since the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the realization that dependency on other countries can be toxic. Internally, rule-of-law violations and disinformation have reduced Europe’s self-confidence in defending its values, and even the largest EU countries lack influence in the US-China rivalry.]

Today the EU is weaker and more vulnerable, facing Russian aggression on its borders and a conflict in the Middle East where it has little influence. Economic security has become a much bigger priority since the COVID-19 pandemic and the realisation that dependency on other countries can become toxic. Not even the largest EU countries have much clout in the United States China rivalry. Internal problems with rule-of-law violations and democracies undermined by disinformation have reduced Europe’s self-confidence in defending its values abroad.

> The EU has become more vulnerable, facing Russian aggression on its borders and a conflict in the Middle East where it has little influence


=== SEGMENT 42 ===
[Summary: Since 2022, the EU has strengthened its security policy by ending its dependence on Russian energy and increasing defense spending to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine and lessen reliance on the US. The EU has also introduced numerous economic security instruments, such as the Chips Act and Anti-Coercion Act, to manage dependencies and protect technology, though their impact is still uncertain, and these efforts coincide with a decline in the EU's relative economic weight.]

Since 2022, the EU has made some progress in its security policy. It is no longer dependent on Russia for energy. Defence spending has risen as member states have sought to replenish stocks of weapons donated to Ukraine and to reduce dependence on the US for their own security. This is adding to pressure on public finances, increasing the need for better coordination of spending. A flurry of economic security-related instruments have been put in place: to reduce import dependency (Chips Act, Critical Raw Materials Act), to deter coercion (Anti-Coercion Act) and to protect sensitive technology and infrastructure (screening of foreign direct investment, export controls, the Cyber-Resilience Act). However, the effectiveness of these instruments remains to be tested. In the meantime, the EU’s relative economic weight is falling as others grow faster.


=== SEGMENT 43 ===
[Summary: The 2024 US election is expected to push Europe toward developing strategic autonomy, as the US will likely remain preoccupied with the China rivalry and the Indo-Pacific region. Despite this need, the EU struggles significantly with foreign policy, finding it difficult to build consensus and failing to secure the support of the Global South regarding Ukraine. These internal and external struggles contribute to the rise of anti-European narratives worldwide.]

The 2024 US election could force Europe to develop its strategic autonomy. Whoever is elected as the next US president will continue the rivalry with China, and Washington will continue to be more absorbed with the Indo-Pacific than with Europe.

On foreign policy, the EU still finds it difficult to build and maintain consensus. Its quest for strategic autonomy from the US is not balanced by enough engagement with other regions. It has failed to win the support of the Global South for Ukraine. The rise of anti-western and anti-European narratives in many parts of the world has been boosted by three consecutive shocks: Europe’s fail


=== SEGMENT 44 ===
[Summary: The rise of anti-European narratives globally is attributed to three major shocks: the failure to share COVID-19 vaccines, the 2022 global spike in energy and food prices caused by European purchasing post-Russian invasion, and the EU's alignment with the US on the Middle East. Furthermore, the EU is criticized for its short-sighted approach to migration, focusing on transactional relationships to control movement rather than developing long-term strategies to address underlying causes like demographic and climate change, despite needing labor.]

ure to share COVID-19 vaccines at the start of the pandemic, the rise in energy and food prices globally in 2022 as Europeans sought to buy whatever they could after the full-scale Russian invasion, and the EU’s unwillingness to break with the US on the Middle East. The EU now finds itself in the unenviable position of having almost no influence over Israel yet being blamed for the suffering of the Palestinians.Meanwhile, many European leaders focus on transactional relationships with neighbouring countries to contain and control migration. There is a lack of EU long-term thinking about the major pressures that are causing people to move, most notably demographic change (such as fast-growing young populations in Africa) and climate change, and the corresponding policy responses. Economic needs to fill labour shortages in Europe are not matched by political willingness to build win-win relationships with the countries of origin and transit. > Many European leaders focus on transactional relationships with neighbouring countries to contain and control migration


=== SEGMENT 45 ===
[Summary: The EU now widely acknowledges China as a rival and a threat, perceiving it as reshaping the international order and acting as a formidable economic competitor, even while remaining an essential trade partner. This complex relationship soured significantly after the EU signed the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020 but refused to ratify it in 2021 following Chinese sanctions on European parliamentarians, a situation exacerbated by China's subsequent alignment with Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.]

China is now widely acknowledged to be a rival, and even a threat, by most EU governments. It is perceived as reshaping the rules-based international order and building an alternative power centre. Yet it remains an essential trade partner and has also become a formidable economic competitor, thanks in part to massive industrial policies. While President Trump was engaged in a trade war with China, many in Europe believed they could remain bystanders. In 2020, the EU even signed a landmark deal with China, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). But in March 2021, the EU decided not to ratify CAI after China imposed sanctions on European parliamentarians and civil society. Then China decided to lean towards Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


=== SEGMENT 46 ===
[Summary: The EU faces internal disagreement on how to 'de-risk' its relationship with China, primarily because powerful sectors like the car industry rely heavily on Chinese market access and supply chains. Concurrently, China's influence on EU members like Hungary is challenging internal cohesion and the rule of law. Separately, the EU must prepare for economic changes resulting from the European Green Deal, using climate diplomacy and conditional funding to help partners achieve sustainability and phase out fossil fuels.]

However, the broad consensus within the EU around the need to ‘de-risk’ the relationship with China is not matched by an agreement on how to achieve it. Politically powerful sectors such as the car industry are keen to maintain their access to the Chinese market, and European economies still depend heavily on Chinese supply chains. China’s influence on EU candidate countries and even a member, Hungary, is undermining values and the rule of law, and challenging cohesion within the EU.Your substantive role will include the climate transition as a major issue. The EU needs to prepare for the changes in its economic relationships resulting from European Green Deal policies. Climate justice will be a recurring theme in relationships with countries affected by EU climate measures and with those that want more help with adaptation. Climate diplomacy, led by you, will need to be linked to more conditional funding to help partners along their transition paths to sustainability, particularly with the goal of phasing out fossil fuels as quickly as possible. > The EU must prepare for the changes in its economic relationships resulting from European Green Deal policies


=== SEGMENT 47 ===
[Summary: The EU faces major foreign policy challenges in reconciling a strong transatlantic alliance with the need for EU autonomy. This difficulty stems from three key differences: the US views China as a threat to its supremacy, while the EU focuses on security and competitiveness; the US is distancing itself from global trade rules, which the trade-dependent EU remains committed to; and US commitment to Europe has structurally declined and become volatile, raising fears of isolationism.]

## Challenges

**Confronting the EU’s major foreign policy problems**
Reconciling a strong transatlantic alliance with EU autonomy. Reconciling the role of the United States as protector and close ally with EU autonomy has become much more challenging. First, attitudes to China are different. As a global power, the US sees China as a threat to its supremacy, while Europe is concerned about its security and competitiveness, but has no supremacy to defend. Second, the US has been increasingly distancing itself from global rules that it helped create, particularly in international trade. The EU remains committed to these rules, partly because it is more trade-dependent, and partly because unconstrained exercise of discretion is not a plausible strategy for a union of sovereign countries, which often disagree. Third, US commitment to Europe has declined structurally – because of the rising importance of Asia – and it has become more volatile. A second Trump presidency might mark a return to isolationism of a kind not seen since the 1920s.


=== SEGMENT 48 ===
[Summary: The EU's relationship with China, previously defined by the 2019 Strategic Outlook as partner, competitor, and systemic rival, must now incorporate the dimension of 'threat.' China's economic coercion and support for Russia's war against Ukraine demonstrate its potential security risk to the EU. The primary challenge is managing this threat while simultaneously preserving cooperation on crucial issues like trade, climate change, and engagement in international forums.]

Manage threats from China while maintaining a constructive relationship. While the three terms coined by the 2019 EU-China Strategic Outlook – partner, competitor and systemic rival – continue to apply (European Commission/HRVP, 2019), another aspect needs to be added: the threat. China’s acts of economic coercion, and its support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, show that China is itself a potential security threat to the EU. Your challenge will be to manage this threat while preserving cooperation on trade and climate change, and in international forums.


=== SEGMENT 49 ===
[Summary: The EU's prosperity is increasingly dependent on strengthening relations with the Global South across three critical areas. These areas include securing accelerated decarbonization from rapidly growing economies like India to meet global emissions targets, diversifying trade relationships away from China to ensure stable supply chains for the EU's green transition, and managing controlled immigration to address demographic and skills challenges. The main difficulty lies in strengthening these ties when the Global South is less reliant on the EU than in previous years.]

**Building stronger relations with the Global South**
The EU’s prosperity depends much more on the Global South than it used to for three main reasons: 1) to meet global emissions reduction targets, rapidly growing economies such as India need to accelerate their decarbonisation; 2) to diversify trade relationships away from China and ensure stable supply chains that support the EU’s green transition; (3) for controlled immigration that helps address the EU’s demographic and skills challenges while avoiding social and political backlash. Your challenge will be to strengthen all three aspects of the relationship at a time when the Global South needs the EU less than in the past.

> The EU’s prosperity depends much more on the Global South than it used to


=== SEGMENT 50 ===
[Summary: The role of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HRVP) is constrained by a contested institutional structure where competition among multiple high-level representatives, including the Presidents of the Commission and European Council, often leads to contradictory EU positions. The HRVP's influence has diminished as many foreign policy decisions have shifted up to the European Council, and the position itself has been demoted within the Commission from first vice-president to one among many. Furthermore, the diversity of member states, ranging from former global powers to smaller countries, limits the EU's capacity to use its external instruments strategically.]

**Addressing the internal challenges to your role**
Your role is constrained by a confusing and contested institutional structure in which multiple external representatives speak on behalf of Europe and control different external instruments. The prominent roles of the President of the Commission and President of the European Council on the world scene have shrunk the space for the HRVP. Presidents and prime ministers seek the limelight, leading to competition, and even contradictions, in the EU’s positions. Even where the EU can wield external instruments, its capacity to use them strategically is limited by the diversity of its members. Some are former global powers that want to shape EU external policies in ways that promote their national interests, while others are smaller countries primarily concerned with their immediate neighbours.The original intention for the HRVP role was policy coordination through ‘double-hatting’ as chair of the Foreign Affairs Council – on the assumption that substantive decisions would be taken by the foreign ministers – and as the second most senior Commissioner. However, since the post was established 15 years ago, many more foreign policy decisions have moved up to the European Council instead, with heads of state and government taking them over from their foreign ministers. Meanwhile, the HRVP position inside the Commission has been demoted from first vice-president to one among many with that title.


=== SEGMENT 51 ===
[Summary: The HRVP's role is diminishing despite the growing interlinkages between economic and hard security, a trend highlighted by the US economic-security doctrine set by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The HRVP lacks control over crucial external instruments such as trade, development funding, and G7 representation, and this marginalization is potentially worsened by Ursula von der Leyen's ambition to create a 'geopolitical Commission' and possibly appoint a new defense commissioner. While the EU currently maintains unity on supporting Ukraine and sanctioning Russia, internal fragmentation and the dispersal of external policy resources are becoming increasingly costly.]

This smaller role for the HRVP contrasts with the growing interlinkages between economic and hard security. For example, the Biden Administration’s economic-security doctrine was set out by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The HRVP, meanwhile, does not control the most powerful external instruments of trade, development funding, enlargement and neighbourhood policy, or representation in the G7. Paradoxically, Ursula von der Leyen’s ambition to create a ‘geopolitical Commission’ has further marginalised the HRVP’s role. If she creates a new defence commissioner who reports directly to her, your job could be eviscerated of its substance also on security.For the moment, the EU is mostly sticking together on providing support to Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia. But with the growing external challenges, internal fragmentation and the dispersal of external policy resources and representation are increasingly costly.


=== SEGMENT 52 ===
[Summary: The recommendations outline key foreign policy challenges for the HRVP, focusing on the US and China. Regarding the US, the HRVP must prepare for potential unpredictability, including the risk of troop withdrawal if President Trump returns, while also working to establish a common EU vision and a transatlantic economic security strategy. Concerning China, the HRVP must reshape the EU strategy due to intensifying rivalry and Beijing's support for Russia, which involves widening the economic dialogue to include security, clarifying the EU's position on Taiwan, and boosting its role in the Indo-Pacific.]

## Recommendations

**Confront the main foreign policy challenges**
You need to work on options for the EU’s response to the US becoming a more unpredictable and unreliable partner, especially if President Trump returns to the White House. Risks could include withdrawal of US troops from European bases.

You must work to bring member states together around a common vision for relations with the US, developing a transatlantic economic security strategy that creates more common ground (if the next president is a Democrat).

> You must work to bring member states together around a common vision for relations with the US

You must play a crucial role in reshaping EU strategy on China as rivalry intensifies and Beijing continues to support Russia, while also conducting massive industrial policies with negative consequences for European exports and for the functioning of the single market. Furthermore, the use of EU defensive tools is hampered by differing views across countries and fear of retaliation. You should widen the High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue with China from trade to economic security, and aim to clarify the EU’s position on Taiwan as well as boosting its role in a free and open Indo-Pacific.

[Summary: The analysis suggests that strengthening relations with India should be a highlight of the mandate, urging engagement with the new governing coalition led by Prime Minister Modi to regain momentum on a comprehensive economic package, referencing the EFTA-India agreement of March 2024, and utilizing the EU-India Trade and Technology Council for technology and economic security cooperation. Furthermore, it stresses that building relationships with the majority of the world, particularly non-industrialized economies, is a core job function, recommending the appointment of regional deputies to manage the workload.]

Relations with India could be a highlight of your mandate. You should engage with the new governing coalition (still led by Prime Minister Modi) to regain momentum on negotiations on a comprehensive economic package, following the example of the Economic Comprehensive Agreement signed between European Free Trade Association members and India in March 2024. Use the EU-India Trade and Technology Council as a platform to deepen technology cooperation and also broader economic security.

> Relations with India could be a highlight of your mandate

Your basic job is to build and maintain relationships. This is especially important in working with the majority of the world, beyond the advanced, industrialised economies. Presence is vital.

[Summary: The EU must modernize its engagement with the Global South, moving beyond post-colonial relationships based on resource extraction and donor-driven aid, especially as other powers build ties in the region. This shift requires leveraging the 2021 Global Gateway initiative to integrate EU diplomacy, funding, and external instruments like trade and development policies. Additionally, the EU needs a more sophisticated, long-term approach to transactional issues such as raw materials agreements and migration management.]

EU member countries without a colonial past in that region.

Now that other powers are also building ties in the Global South, the EU has to move on from post-colonial relationships based on resource extraction and donor-driven aid. The establishment of the Global Gateway (European Commission, 2021) was the first step in defining a new paradigm, and you should work with the commissioner responsible for international partnerships on a follow up that brings together your diplomacy with the EU’s money and other external instruments. That means leveraging Council relationships as well as coordinating policies run by the Commission, such as trade and development.

You will need to take a more sophisticated approach to two issues where some EU countries would like to have primarily transactional relationships: raw materials agreements, where resource-rich countries now find themselves in a sellers’ market, and migration, on which longer-term thinking is needed on the EU’s strategic goals and options for steering the movement of people and responding to EU labour-market needs.

[Summary: The EU must improve its climate diplomacy by ensuring partners are not surprised by new regulations, citing the Deforestation Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115) as an example where lack of forewarning led to partners feeling betrayed. The text also stresses the necessity of better defining the role and powers of the High Representative/Vice-President (HRVP) to adapt to a world dominated by intimidation and declining European influence, noting that the Treaty on European Union currently lacks a precise definition of the HRVP's authority.]

On climate diplomacy, you must make sure partners are not surprised by EU moves, as they were by the Deforestation Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115). The regulation was itself needed, as the carbon border adjustment mechanism will be, but partner-country leaders felt betrayed by lack of forewarning and discussion. You will need to work with the commissioners responsible for climate and environment to show that the EU really does support partners’ own chosen transition paths.

> On climate diplomacy, you must make sure partners are not surprised by EU moves

**Better define your role**
A stark choice has to be made on how to adapt the HRVP role to a world dominated by intimidation and brute force, where European influence is declining and its engagement needs to intensify in many regions simultaneously. Unfortunately, the Treaty on European Union lacks a precise definition of the powers of the HRVP. There are two possible options.


=== SEGMENT 56 ===
[Summary: The first and best option for adapting the HRVP role proposes that the European Council grant the HRVP a stronger mandate for common actions, supported by enhanced legal and financial capabilities. In this model, the HRVP would become 'first among equals' among foreign ministers and relevant commissioners. On the Commission side, the HRVP would reassume the role of First Vice-President (HRFVP), supervising and convening commissioners responsible for key external portfolios like trade, partnerships, enlargement, and defense to coordinate strategy.]

The first and best option is for the European Council to give the HRVP a stronger mandate to act on matters on which member states have decided to take common actions. In a world in which security and economic threats are linked, this would require stronger legal and financial capabilities to coordinate relevant policies in the EU institutions. In this model, you would be ‘first among equals’, both among the foreign ministers and among all commissioners with portfolios that touch on EU external relations.

-   On the Commission side, you would reassume the role of First Vice-President of the Commission (HRFVP), with responsibility for supervising the commissioners responsible for trade, international partnerships, enlargement and the neighbourhood, crisis and humanitarian operations, and defence. You would convene these commissioners regularly to set a strategic direction and coordinate the use of Commission instruments.


=== SEGMENT 57 ===
[Summary: To increase policy coherence, the HRFVP would chair the foreign affairs, defence, and potentially development and trade councils, and would also chair a proposed Economic Security Council (as suggested by Letta, 2024). In the European Council, the HRFVP would adopt a role similar to the US National Security Advisor, preparing external policy packages for leaders and coordinating external policy councils with the European Council President. This expanded function would necessitate designating deputies for specific issues and requiring the European External Action Service to provide strategic support.]

-   On the Council of Ministers side, you as HRFVP would chair the foreign affairs, defence and possibly development and trade councils, to bring more coherence to the discussions among these different ministers. If an Economic Security Council is created (as proposed by Letta, 2024), it would also be chaired by you. To make the job manageable, you should designate other commissioners and/or individual foreign ministers as deputies responsible for particular issues and/or geographical relationships, reviving a tradition used by previous HRVPs.
-   In the European Council, you as HRFVP should use your seat rather like the National Security Advisor does in the US Cabinet, preparing external policy packages for leaders to decide, working closely with the European Council President to link the external policy Councils (including trade, development and defence) to that power centre, and doing the preparatory work across the institutions. That would require the European External Action Service to support you with strategic thinking and more innovative proposals.

> In the European Council, you should use your seat rather like the National Security Advisor does in the US Cabinet


=== SEGMENT 58 ===
[Summary: The relationship between the HRFVP, the Commission President, and the Council President requires close teamwork, although both Presidents retain powers to control the agenda, such as moving issues to the European Council or keeping matters within the Commission's exclusive domain. An alternative model suggests accepting the HRVP's currently circumscribed authority and establishing a clear division of labor to avoid turf battles, which would mean the HRVP forsakes responsibilities for areas like trade, development, enlargement, and neighborhood policy.]

The President of the Commission could still decide to keep within her exclusive domain certain matters belonging to EU competence, while the President of the Council would always be able to move issues up to the European Council for decision. The two Presidents and you as HRFVP would have to work together closely as a team.

A second option would accept that your authority as HRVP is today more circumscribed than envisaged by the Lisbon Treaty, and could shrink further if the role of the commissioner responsible for defence extends beyond military procurement into defence policy. The aim would be to establish a clear division of labour between yourself and other commissioners whose portfolios have an external dimension, to avoid turf battles. This would imply forsaking responsibility for trade policy, development, enlargement and neighbourhood, which would remain the remit of dedicated commissioners.


=== SEGMENT 59 ===
[Summary: This segment outlines a minimalist model for the HRFVP role, where the Commissioner responsible for defence assumes control over military staff, intelligence, and chairs the European Defence Agency's Steering Board to ensure coherence between security and industrial policies. Under this reduced mandate, the HRFVP's leading role is limited to three core areas: coordinating common foreign and security positions among member states, external representation via the EEAS, and proposing and announcing economic sanctions.]

To maintain coherence on hard security, the commissioner responsible for defence would take over the military staff and intelligence, mirroring the division between foreign and defence ministers at national level, and replace you as chair of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, in order to link security and industrial policies. In this minimalist model – which is less than the responsibilities given to you on defence under the EU treaties – you would be assigned a leading role in just three fields: 1) coordination of common positions on foreign and security matters where the 27 member states can agree, 2) external representation of EU common positions and the diplomatic network of EU delegations through the European External Action Service (EEAS), 3) proposing and announcing economic sanctions once decisions have been taken by member states.


=== SEGMENT 60 ===
[Summary: The analysis contrasts the institutional impacts of the two proposed models for the HRVP role. The second, more minimalist option risks increasing the Commission's dominance in geopolitical affairs due to poor Council coordination, marginalizing the HRVP in key relationships like those with the US and China. Conversely, the first model is favored for its efficacy, allowing the HRVP to take coordination initiatives, improve the EEAS, better align sanctions with economic-security instruments, and strengthen the case for increased external-action funding in the EU budget.]

The second option would change the institutional balance. Lack of coordination on the Council side would increase the dominance of the Commission in relationships that are both geo-economic and geopolitical. That could increase free-riding and hostage taking, as member states would be more reluctant to expand the use of qualified majority voting and constructive abstention in Council decisions. Under the second model, you would not play a significant role in policy relating to the US, China or other crucial relationships, where the Commission president and large member states would lead.

The advantage of the first model is its efficacy, as you would have the space to take initiatives – largely still regarding coordination – and to improve the functioning of the EEAS and its relationship with the Commission. Responsibility for sanctions, which now lies with you, would be coordinated better with the activation of economic-security instruments, which is the responsibility of the Commission. With this model working more effectively, it would be easier for you to argue for an increase in external-action funding in the next EU budget.


=== SEGMENT 61 ===
[Summary: The analysis recommends several improvements for the EU's external action, even if a less preferred institutional model is adopted, focusing on upgrading EU delegations with better personnel and expertise and granting them stronger coordinating roles. Crucially, the High Representative should have a final say in appointing delegation heads alongside the Commission President. The text concludes by urging the EU to choose a model and stop the practice of assigning powers without the ability to exercise them, warning that disempowerment will increase systemic dysfunction.]

> EU delegations should be upgraded in terms of personnel and expertise

Even if only the second model proves to be feasible, several improvements should be made to the current situation. In particular, EU delegations should be upgraded in terms of personnel and expertise, and should be given stronger roles in coordinating EU instruments on the ground. Furthermore, you should have a final say in the appointments of heads of delegations (together with the Commission President), so that these top diplomats have personal links to you.

We believe the first model is preferable. But most important is that the EU makes a choice and breaks the bad habit of nominally assigning powers to you while depriving you of the ability to exercise them in practice. Disempowering your position would make the system even more dysfunctional.

[Summary: This memo, authored by Guntram Wolff, advises the Commissioner responsible for defence on tackling the major challenges posed by Russian imperialism and potential US retreat, emphasizing that the outcome of the war in Ukraine will shape European security for decades. The Commissioner must push for expanded and efficient EU defense spending, improved procurement utilizing the single market, and greater integration while defining a clear role relative to the High Representative and the Single Market Commissioner. The role should also focus on maximizing innovation benefits and potentially expanding to include broader security and intelligence files.]

# Memo to the commissioner responsible for defence

**Guntram Wolff**

You face the major challenge of Russian imperialism in the context of a potential retreat from Europe by the United States. The outcome of the war in Ukraine will shape European security for decades. EU defence spending is neither sufficient nor efficient. You must push for expanded military production and improved procurement, making the most of the EU single market. You will have to convince EU governments of the benefits of greater integration of the defence market and a reduction in national gold-plating and local industrial policy, while also preventing unjustified protectionism against foreign producers.

You also need to focus on the innovation benefits of greater defence spending. Your role will need clear demarcation in relation to the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy and the commissioner responsible for the single market. With some ambition, your role could include broader security and intelligence files, surpassing the weak role of the European External Action Service.

- Support Ukraine and resist the Russian threat
- Expand military production and improve procurement
- Maximise single-market benefits

[Summary: Ensuring territorial integrity is a core strategic, political, and economic priority for the EU, as citizens expect protection from external threats. National defense forces function as a European public good, contributing to collective deterrence and protecting neighboring countries by defending national (and thus EU) territory. This framework is supported by EU treaties, which foresee the possibility of mutual defence support among member states.]

## State of affairs

European Union citizens expect their governments to protect them from external threats. Ensuring territorial integrity is a core strategic, political and economic priority and any infringement of it would have incalculable consequences for the EU. While national forces provide for security, they also provide a European public good. In defending national territory and thereby EU territory, they protect neighbouring countries and contribute to collective deterrence. EU treaties foresee the possibility of mutual defence support to be provided to other EU countries. In surv

[Summary: The analysis identifies Russian neo-imperialism as the biggest threat to European security since the Cold War, posing an existential danger to Ukraine and potentially a direct threat to EU member states. A Russian victory in Ukraine could embolden further territorial conquests and test the credibility of NATO's Article 5 and the EU's mutual defense obligations. Furthermore, Russia actively undermines Western democracies through hybrid warfare, disinformation campaigns, and interference in elections across the EU, UK, and US.]

eys, European citizens want the EU to play a larger role in defence. In this context, you need to reflect on three major issues.

**Russian neo-imperialism**
Europe faces the biggest threat to its security since the end of the Cold War. Russian imperialism is an existential threat to Ukraine and may well be a direct threat to EU countries. The outcome of the war in Ukraine will shape European security for decades. Putin’s Russia might be emboldened to further territorial conquests if it succeeds in Ukraine, and in this scenario would be able to draw on the joint resources of 140 million Russians and 40 million Ukrainians. The credibility of NATO’s Article 5 deterrence and the EU’s mutual defence obligation[^1] would then be tested. But Putin’s totalitarianism is not only dangerous in countries under his control and in Russia’s neighbourhood. Russia has engaged in hybrid warfare, influence operations, disinformation campaigns and interference in elections and referenda in many EU countries, the United Kingdom, United States and other allies.


=== SEGMENT 65 ===
[Summary: Although European defense spending surpasses Russia's, Russia maintains a critical advantage in ammunition production capacity over all NATO allies combined. Furthermore, Russia has managed to reconstitute its land forces despite significant losses in Ukraine, resulting in an army that is now 15 percent larger than its size at the start of the 2022 invasion and is more experienced on the battlefield.]

European defence spending exceeds that of Russia. Yet Russia’s ammunition production capacities are greater than that of all NATO allies. Moreover, Russia – while having suffered significant losses in land forces in Ukraine – has been able to reconstitute that force; its army is now 15 percent larger than when it invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and has learned significantly on the battlefield.

> Europe faces the biggest threat to its security since the end of the Cold War

**US retreat**
The security situation is compounded by the gradual retreat of the United States from Europe. During and since the Cold War, the US presence in Europe has been of central importance to collective security. But depending on the 2024 US election outcome, US interest in Europe in general and Ukraine more specifically may decline quickly. The questions then would be if and how Europe can organise defence with less-to-no US involvement, and how it could provide the necessary support to Ukraine to prevent a Ukrainian defeat and even empower Ukraine to liberate its full territory. The EU and Ukraine need to import military equipment and US industries dominate global markets.


=== SEGMENT 66 ===
[Summary: The EU is deeply dependent on the US across strategic, military, industrial, and financial domains, largely because EU capitals lack the capacity to design or agree upon a common security strategy. European countries specifically lack critical military assets, including intelligence capabilities and a nuclear umbrella. This dependence is highlighted by the fact that the US has contributed approximately 40 percent of total aid allocated to Ukraine since February 2022, though these financial flows are now becoming less certain.]

Dependence on the US exists at strategic level because EU capitals have little capacity to design a security strategy, let alone agree on a common approach. The EU’s 2022 Strategic Compass falls short of the leadership provided by the US. The EU is also dependent on US military capabilities, industrial capacity and financial resources. European countries lack critical military assets (for example troop deployment capacity, intelligence, satellite communication and geolocation, a nuclear umbrella) (Gonzales Laya et al, 2024; Biscop and Murillo, 2024). Since February 2022, the US has contributed about 40 percent of total aid allocated to Ukraine. The US retreat is already visible as these financial flows have become less certain in the pre-election competition, while many influential US voices call for restraint on weapon supplies to prioritise US strategic interests in Asia[^2].

> Dependence on the US exists at strategic level because EU capitals have little capacity to design a security strategy


=== SEGMENT 67 ===
[Summary: The integration of European defence capacities is a long-standing goal dating back to the 1950s, but defence remains primarily a national responsibility, with NATO serving as the main organizational framework. Despite this, the EU has developed a complex governance structure under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), involving bodies like the European Defence Authority (EDA) and the EU military staff. Decision-making in EU defence governance is predominantly intergovernmental and requires unanimity among member states.]

**EU defence governance**
The idea of integrating European defence capacities is not new. It dates to the 1950s when a European defence community treaty had been negotiated but not ratified. Since then, European defence has been mostly organised in a NATO framework. The recent accessions of Finland and Sweden to NATO further underline the importance of NATO.

Defence is and will remain a national responsibility of the European Union’s 27 countries, yet there have been some EU-level developments. In particular, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy encompasses a Commission Defence Industry and Space directorate-general, a crisis-management and planning directorate within the European External Action Service (EEAS), an EU military staff, a Foreign Affairs Council meeting with defence ministers (with meetings prepared by the Military Committee, EUMC) and agencies including the European Defence Authority (EDA), which was created in 2004 to promote defence collaboration in the EU. The principal task of the EDA is to help EU countries spend better, including by managing joint projects and helping acquire military assets. EU governance in the defence area is thus fairly complex and decision-making is mostly intergovernmental with a unanimity requirement.

[Summary: The recipient faces the dual challenge of defining their job description and addressing substantial issues in European defence procurement and arms deliveries. Defining the role is complicated by the fact that the recipient is not a defence minister, lacks strategic resources (which reside mostly with member states and NATO), and must clarify their responsibilities relative to the High Representative and the Commissioner for the single market. The evolution of the EU's relationship with NATO will also directly impact the scope of this new role.]

## Challenges

You face two sets of challenges. First, you need clarity on your job description. Second, you will have to focus on the substantial challenges facing the European defence industry, military procurement and the organisation of arms deliveries.

**Defining the role**
You are not a defence minister and you do not command any army (with the possible exception of the EU Rapid Deployment Capability, to be established by 2025, which is currently foreseen to be politically led by the Council and the military planning and conduct capability of the EEAS). You also have limited strategic resources, intelligence and planning capacities, which all essentially reside with member states and NATO and to a limited extent with the EEAS.

The EU will have to define how its relationship with NATO will evolve and this will directly impact your job description. Within the EU it is still unclear how exactly your responsibilities will interact with those of the High Representative of the Union, who currently heads foreign and security policy, including on defence matters. The High Representative is in charge of the EEAS, the European Union Military Staff and chairs the Foreign Affairs Council (including in its defence composition). The High Representative also heads the EDA. Your role will also have to be defined clearly relative to that of the Commissioner for the single market, who also oversees the defence industrial agenda at the EU level.

[Summary: The war in Ukraine, now a war of attrition, requires the EU to urgently expand military production capacity, improve cost effectiveness, and increase willingness to pay for defence. Decades of underinvestment and restrictive rules have left domestic production minimal, leading to substantial reliance on imports despite recent increases in spending, particularly in Eastern Europe. Furthermore, EU defence markets remain fragmented due to national policies, resulting in excessive unit costs, a structural problem that existing cooperation mechanisms like PESCO and the EDA have failed to resolve.]

**Expanding military production and improving procurement**
The war in Ukraine is turning into a war of attrition. Winning such a war is a question of production capacity, cost effectiveness and willingness to pay. You will need to show leadership in each of these three areas.

After decades of European underinvestment in defence and restrictive export permission rules, domestic production capacity was at minimal levels. Production is still too low compared to demand, despite some increases in the last two years. Defence spending and the share of spending on equipment has increased, especially in Eastern European countries. As equipment spending increases, the defence industry will tend to grow and how the market will shape up will be a key topic for you (see Figure 1). However, imports have increased substantially, reflecting the limited capacity of EU industry to meet rising demand.

EU markets for defence products remain fragmented with national gold-plating and industrial policy preferences contributing to excessive costs per unit. Neither EDA nor the Defence Procurement Directive and the Intra-Community Transfers Directives (2009/81/EC, 2009/43/EC), nor the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), a mechanism agreed by 26 EU member states to advance cooperation on defence, have addressed the issue. The defence industry strongly depends on its main customer – government – that regulates production and exports.


=== SEGMENT 70 ===
[Summary: The European defense industry faces structural challenges, including home bias in procurement that leads to dominant national champions but low production volumes due to fragmented markets, consequently driving up unit prices, such as the quadrupling cost of 155mm shells. Further hindering capacity are cumbersome administrative processes, critical supply chain dependencies, and the slow integration of advanced digital technologies like AI and autonomous systems, a sector where US companies are increasingly taking the lead.]

The home bias in procurement has allowed national champions to acquire dominant positions in some of the national markets, while still producing relatively low quantities with possibly low margins because of the limited size of the domestic market. Relatively low production numbers – related to fragmented markets – drive up unit prices. Cumbersome administrative processes hold back increases in production capacity. Because supply lags demand, unit prices of 155mm shells, for example, increased by a factor of four[^3]. The EU defence industry also faces some critical dependencies in supply chains for some weapon systems. Speeding up the use and integration of advanced digital technology is another major challenge for European defence industry policy. Artificial intelligence and autonomous systems play increasingly important roles on the battlefield; US companies are increasingly taking the lead in this sector.

[Summary: Figure 1 displays the defence equipment spending as a percentage of total defence spending for six selected countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, UK, and US) for 2024 and 2023 (estimated). The data reveals significant decreases in the share of equipment spending between 2023 and 2024 for several European nations, most notably Poland (52% to 19%), Germany (26% to 13%), and Italy (23% to 11%). In 2024, the US had the highest share at 26%, while Italy had the lowest at 11%.]

[Summary: Europe must strengthen its defense industrial base to increase output, reduce strategic dependence, and advance the technological frontier. While the proposed European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) is viewed as a good starting point, it is criticized for being too optimistic about the short-term capacities of the EU’s EDTIB. Critics also argue that EDIS overemphasizes reducing weapon imports and lacks concrete ideas for addressing market fragmentation and reducing costs.]

In sum, Europe needs to strengthen its defence industrial base to increase output and reduce strategic dependence and vulnerabilities, while catching up and advancing the technological frontier. The European defence industrial strategy (EDIS) proposed by your predecessors is a good start but is too optimistic on the short-term capacities of the EU’s EDTIB. It overemphasises the goal of reducing weapon imports and offers no concrete ideas on how to address the fragmentation of the market and reduce costs (Wolff, 2024).

=== SEGMENT 73 ===
[Summary: If the Defence Commissioner's role is defined narrowly, their primary focus would be on defence industrial strategy and advancing European armament, utilizing the EU’s regulatory powers to boost production and improve the single market for defence. This role would be supported by a small European Defence Fund dedicated to research and development. The Commissioner would cooperate with the High Representative, possibly under their authority, to ensure defence industrial policy measures are coherent with the Commission’s broader industrial strategy and overall security goals.]

pean armament. You will rely on the EU’s regulatory powers to advance production and the functioning of the single market for defence. A small European Defence Fund will give you a limited instrument to advance defence research and development. In this scenario, you would cooperate, possibly under the authority of the High Representative, on the nexus between defence and security strategy and industrial policy. The High Representative heads the EDA and manages with member states the European Peace Facility, the financial instrument to support weapon purchases. Your role would be to support the High Representative in ensuring the coherence of the overall package and that defence industrial policy measures are fully anchored in the Commission’s broader industrial policy strategy.


=== SEGMENT 74 ===
[Summary: A broader definition of the Defence Commissioner's role would grant authority over armaments policies, joint procurement, military strategy, and intelligence preparation. This model proposes transferring significant military and intelligence operational capacity from the EEAS to the Commission. Such a move aims to overcome the current weakness of the EEAS model against member state influence, thereby creating a more powerful European Commission with major geopolitical relevance in areas like intelligence and defence procurement.]

**Armaments policy and joint procurement**However, if your role is defined more broadly you might have greater authority over armaments policies, joint procurement and, possibly, also the preparation of military strategy and military intelligence. Similarly to a national context, in which the foreign ministry is not in charge of defence but rather of the diplomatic services, it would make sense to transfer significant parts of the EEAS military and intelligence operational and executive capacity to the Commission under your authority. This model would overcome the weakness of the EEAS model in the face of the relatively large influence of member states, and would create a more powerful European Commission with major geopolitically relevant powers in trade, finance, single market, intelligence and defence procurement.


=== SEGMENT 75 ===
[Summary: The proposed model aims to advance a European strategic culture and military capabilities by transferring existing EU intelligence and military staff under the new authority. This transfer is expected to improve operational effectiveness in providing intelligence necessary for executive decision-making to the Council and the Presidents. Additionally, this role would involve preparing strategic option papers reflecting European interests for the Commission President to bring before the European Council.]

The advantage of this model would be to advance a European strategic culture and military capabilities. The transfer of existing EU intelligence and EU military staff to your authority would improve operational effectiveness in providing intelligence needed for executive decision making to the Council and the Presidents. The Commission President could rely on you to prepare strategic option papers reflecting European interests, which would be brought before the European Council.


=== SEGMENT 76 ===
[Summary: Under the proposed model, the new defense authority would automatically participate in all Foreign Affairs Council meetings, providing intelligence and updates on the defense industry and support for Ukraine. The High Representative's role would subsequently narrow to focus exclusively on foreign affairs, leading diplomatic missions and chairing the Council. This structural change is intended to strengthen the Commission as the EU executive and eliminate the current ineffective 'double-hat' construction of the High Representative.]

You would automatically participate in all Foreign Affairs Council meetings, particularly those with defence ministers. In that constellation, you should provide intelligence to ministers and update them on the defence industry and support for Ukraine. The High Representative role would correspondingly become focused on foreign affairs, leading the diplomatic missions and chairing the Foreign Affairs Council. The advantage of that model would be to clearly strengthen the Commission as the EU executive while moving the High Representative to the Council, effectively bringing to an end the current, ineffective ‘double-hat’ construction in which the High Representative is in the Council and the Commission at the same time.


=== SEGMENT 77 ===
[Summary: The proposed defence industrial strategy aims to boost production, reduce prices, and advance innovation primarily by utilizing the single market. This requires integrating the defence market and overcoming national biases and 'gold-plating' in procurement, a difficult task that necessitates convincing member states of the benefits. While increasing competition and reducing fragmentation is expected to lower costs and increase output, this approach will likely face resistance from national industries and governments.]

**Defence industrial strategy**To boost production, reduce prices and advance innovation in defence, your most powerful tool will be the single market. Integrating the single market and overcoming national biases in defence procurement is a difficult task. You will have to convince member states of the benefits of greater integration of the defence market and a reduction in national gold-plating and local industrial policy. Increasing competition and increasing the size of the market will help the European defence industry to lower prices while increasing output. Reducing fragmentation and increasing competition will of course be resisted by national industries and governments, as it has in many other sectors.


=== SEGMENT 78 ===
[Summary: Integrating the defense market requires critically judging arguments concerning specific national military requirements. The growing demand for defense products is expected to incentivize companies to accept increased competition. Furthermore, the sustained pressure on public budgets serves as the most powerful argument for achieving cost reduction through greater market integration.]

In defence, powerful arguments will be made about how important specific national requirements for military success are; you will have to judge those critically. The growing demand for defence products should provide sufficient incentives to convince companies that the increased competition is acceptable. And the long and sustained demands on public budgets will be your most powerful argument in making the case for bringing down costs through more market integration.

> You will have to convince member states of the benefits of greater integration of the defence market


=== SEGMENT 79 ===
[Summary: Joint procurement is identified as a key strategy to integrate defence markets and reduce costs, leveraging existing EU instruments such as the European Peace Facility (€17 billion) and the European Defence Fund (€8 billion), both covering 2021-2027. A major goal is convincing member states to allocate portions of their increased defence budgets to these EU instruments. Given the long-term nature of defence investment, joint borrowing mechanisms will be prioritized for funding innovation and continued support for Ukraine.]

**Joint procurement will help you integrate markets and reduce costs**Your starting point will be the European Peace Facility, a fund worth €17 billion for 2021-27 and mostly used to support Ukraine, and a European Defence Fund of €8 billion for 2021-27 to support companies with cooperative projects in defence R&D. You will have to convince those countries that are increasing their defence budgets to also allocate some funds to such EU instruments. Since some of that spending will be forward looking and will have the character of investment that should last for years, joint borrowing mechanisms will be high on your agenda, for both the funding of innovation and Ukraine support.

> Joint borrowing mechanisms will be high on your agenda, for both the funding of innovation and Ukraine support


=== SEGMENT 80 ===
[Summary: The integration of the European defence market must actively include key partner countries, such as the UK and Japan. The UK is identified as a major ally and essential defence industry player for European security. Furthermore, Ukraine has become a significant weapons producer, attracting companies to manufacture there due to lower costs and the opportunity to directly test new systems.]

When advocating for the integration of the European market for defence products, you should not lose sight of partner countries. The UK is a major ally and defence industry player, essential for European security. Ukraine has become a major producer of weapons and many companies now want to produce in Ukraine, not only because it is relatively cheap but also to directly test new systems. In your industrial strategy, you should also advance cooperation with partners such as Japan.


=== SEGMENT 81 ===
[Summary: The European defence market consists of both private and public companies, but evidence suggests private firms operating without government intervention perform better, delivering products faster and cheaper. To overcome slow national processes, the EU should organize joint procurement, potentially via the EDA, ensuring market logic prevails while protecting company autonomy. This principle of encouraging market forces and limiting bureaucracy should also guide major projects, such as the Franco-German Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) tank development.]

The European market for defence companies is characterised by a mix of private and public companies. Experience suggests that private companies in which management operates with authority and without government intervention through government shareholding tend to perform better – with more effective and faster deliveries at lower prices[^4]. You should organise EU procurement, for example by the EDA, for several member states to overcome slow, fragmented and excessively bureaucratic national procurement processes, while protecting the autonomy of defence companies to deliver the best products following market logic. You will also have to define a position towards the Franco-German development, agreed in April 2024, of a next-generation tank known as the Main Ground Combat System, a project in which you should encourage market forces and limit bureaucracy.

[Summary: The analysis suggests that Europe should deter unjustified protectionism, as importing cheaper and more effective foreign weapons is beneficial. However, directing some European demand to the domestic industry is necessary to advance innovation and maintain a strong defence sector. Therefore, goals aimed at increasing the domestic share of production, such as the EDIS goal, should focus strategically on high-tech military equipment with substantial intellectual property benefits, rather than mass-produced products.]

**Deter unjustified protectionism against foreign producers**Europe benefits from importing weapons, in particular if they are cheaper and more effective than domestically produced systems. At the same time, you want to direct some of the European demand to the domestic industry to ensure that innovation in Europe advances – a major benefit of a strong defence industry. A greater domestic share of production may therefore make sense in products with substantial intellectual property benefits. This suggests focussing the EDIS domestic-share goal (to purchase a larger share from domestic producers; Wolff, 2024) on specific high-tech military equipment, rather than mass-produced products.

[Summary: The defense market is being transformed by the increasing use of AI and autonomous systems. To support innovation, it is necessary to ensure new entrants, especially high-tech firms, have a level playing field and access to public procurement, which is currently dominated by large domestic incumbents. A larger European budget could help nurture these emerging firms and integrate them as truly European players.]

The defence market is undergoing huge changes with the increasing use of AI and autonomous systems. You need to ensure that new entrants into the European market find a level playing field and access to public procurement – which is dominated by large domestic incumbents. A bigger European budget could be a way to nurture new emerging high-tech firms in particular and make them truly European players.

[Summary: The text addresses the need for further single-market integration in EU defense procurement, highlighting two key proposed initiatives: the European Defence Industry Programme (under EDIS) and the Structure for European Armament Programme. The primary challenge is ensuring these programs are implemented effectively, avoiding excessive bureaucracy, and functioning as flexible instruments to drive innovation and industrial development.]

**Further single-market integration**An important question is about how EU procurement will support single-market integration. Under EDIS, a European Defence Industry Programme has been proposed, with extremely limited financial resources until the next EU budget. There is also a Structure for European Armament Programme to complement the current PESCO programme. Your role is to make these initiatives work. You will have to avoid excessive bureaucracy and make them into flexible instruments that drive innovation and industrial development.

[Summary: The European Union must maintain the transatlantic relationship, as Europe remains dependent on strategic weapon imports from the US for military and capacity reasons, and these purchases serve important foreign policy goals. While boosting domestic production, the EU must approach the US with strategic embeddedness and coordinate strategies for weapon export rules to foster a joint understanding of appropriate customers and weapon types.]

**Maintain the transatlantic relationship**Europe will remain dependent on strategic weapon imports from the US for military and capacity reasons. Also from a foreign policy perspective, purchases from the US may serve important strategic goals in the transatlantic relationship. While you want to boost domestic industrial production, you will need to approach the US with appropriate strategic embeddedness.

As you want to develop the European defence industry, you should aim to coordinate the strategies for rules on weapon exports and foster a joint understanding on which destination countries are appropriate customers for which types of weapons.

[Summary: The defense industry faces significant funding challenges, stemming from the stigmatization of private investment and higher funding costs for SMEs compared to non-defense sectors, necessitating collaboration with the commissioner responsible for financial services to address these bottlenecks. The new role will receive intense scrutiny due to the fragile security situation on the continent and the fundamental differences in defense policy that persist among EU member states, notably between France and Germany.]

The defence industry itself also faces funding challenges. Private funding for the defence industry remains stigmatised and funding costs for SMEs are more expensive than outside the defence sector. You will have to play a major role in tackling private-sector funding bottlenecks in collaboration with the commissioner responsible for financial services.

As you take up your position, the security situation on the continent remains fragile and your job will receive a lot of attention and scrutiny. In defence more than in many other fields fundamental differences exists among EU member states, including between France and Germany. Visionary leadership combined with humbleness and realism will be a winning mix as you approach the job.

[Summary: A memo by Petros C. Mavroidis and André Sapir identifies three core challenges for the EU Trade Commissioner: maintaining open markets and multilateralism, continuing free trade agreements, and addressing resistance from the Global South regarding trade-climate policies such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). To meet these goals, the Commissioner is advised to champion open trade, resist coercion, push for WTO reform, and focus on the trade-climate-development nexus.]

# Memo to the commissioner responsible for trade

**Petros C. Mavroidis and André Sapir**

You face three main challenges: maintain the EU’s commitment to open markets at home and abroad by continuing to adhere to the multilateral rules-based trading system; continue to sign and implement free trade agreements; and head-off the resistance from the Global South to trade-climate policies such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism.

To meet the challenges, you must champion open trade and multilateralism despite the headwinds, continue to facilitate security and climate cooperation, tackle distorting industrial policy by pushing for World Trade Organisation reform, resist Chinese or US trade coercion and find new ways to address the trade-climate-development nexus.

- Champion open trade and multilateralism
- Resist coercion; push WTO reform
- Address the trade-climate-development nexus


=== SEGMENT 90 ===
[Summary: Historically, the European Union's trade policy was primarily economic, aiming to foster the wellbeing of EU firms and consumers by maintaining open markets and adhering to the multilateral rules-based trading system. This strategy proved successful, resulting in the EU ranking second globally in goods trade (excluding intra-EU trade) and first in services trade. This economic focus was maintained during periods when geopolitical considerations played only a minor role, such as the era of 'hyper-globalisation' following the Cold War.]

## State of affairs

Until recently, the objective of European Union trade policy was mainly economic: to foster (together with the single market) an environment favourable to the economic wellbeing of EU firms and consumers. The main task was to maintain open markets at home and abroad by promoting adherence to the multilateral rules-based trading system. The success of this strategy is reflected by the fact that the EU’s rank in world goods trade (excluding intra-EU trade) is second in exports (behind China) and imports (behind the United States). The EU ranks first in the export and import of services.

This state of affairs persisted while geopolitical considerations played only a minor role in the conduct of trade policy in the EU and elsewhere – first during the Cold War, when globalisation proceeded only within the Western sphere, and then after the Cold War and before the China-US confrontation, when all countries joined the multilateral trading system by adhering to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and ‘hyper-globalisation’ meant truly global trade and investment integration, dominated by purely economic considerations and global value chains.


=== SEGMENT 91 ===
[Summary: Geopolitical and climate considerations are increasingly dominating economic policies, including trade policy, often overshadowing purely economic objectives. Major economies are deploying new strategies focused on 'economic security' and climate neutrality, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Net Zero Industry Act. These strategies typically rely on subsidies and industrial policies, often carrying a protectionist element.]

Today, however, geopolitical and climate considerations often dominate purely economic ones in the shaping of economic policies, including trade policy. The EU and other economies have put in place various economic policies in response to concerns about ‘economic security’ – a term that more often than not has a strong national security or geopolitical flavour. The EU and other economies have also been deploying various economic policies to meet international commitments to reach climate neutrality.

> Increasingly, security and climate objectives are part of the deployment of economic strategies

Increasingly, security and climate objectives are part of the deployment of economic strategies in China (with ‘Made in China 2025’), the US (with the Inflation Reduction Act) and the EU (with the Net Zero Industry Act), as well as in other major trading countries. Such strategies typically involve subsidies and other forms of industrial policy, often with a protectionist angle if not intent.


=== SEGMENT 92 ===
[Summary: The deployment of new economic policies focused on security and climate is fragmenting world markets, signaling the end of "hyper-globalisation." While trade has not reversed, it has leveled off, a phenomenon characterized as "slowbalisation." This geopolitical competition, particularly between the US and China, has also caused paralysis at the WTO, which struggles with outdated rules concerning security, climate, subsidies, and digital trade, compounded by the difficulty of achieving consensus among its 166 members.]

Altogether, these various policies have started to fragment world markets, though the term ‘deglobalisation’ is probably incorrect at this stage. The period of hyper-globalisation, during which world trade increased much faster than world production, seems to be over, but globalisation has not reversed, at least if one considers trade in goods and services together. Instead, it seems to have levelled off, hence the term ‘slowbalisation’ to characterise the current period.

The current geopolitical situation, in particular the economic and strategic competition between China and the United States, has led to paralysis at the WTO. Suspension of the Appellate Body because of the US’s continuing objections is just one aspect. The WTO, which now counts 166 members, has suffered from two main problems for a while. First, some of its rules, including those that relate to security and climate measures, and also subsidies and digital trade, are outdated. Second, the economic and political diversity of its members and the fact that decisions are taken by consensus, which essentially gives veto power to any member, make reform very complicated.

> The current geopolitical situation has led to paralysis at the WTO


=== SEGMENT 93 ===
[Summary: Despite ongoing paralysis and internal issues, the WTO maintains a central role in global trade, with an estimated 80-90 percent of world trade still governed by its rules, although the US openly disregards some of them. Members continue to participate actively in daily meetings in Geneva and biennial Ministerial Conferences, such as the one held in Abu Dhabi in March 2024. In response to this environment, EU trade policy remains committed to multilateralism but has adjusted by pursuing free-trade agreements alongside the adoption of unilateral, autonomous instruments.]

Despite these problems, the WTO continues to play a central role in the trade policies of all its members, including China, the US and the EU. Despite WTO paralysis, none of its members has decided so far to disregard existing rules completely – although the US is openly flouting some of these rules. We estimate that 80-90 percent of world trade continues to fall under WTO rules, the main exception being the US tariff surcharge on imports from China added by President Trump and further increased by President Biden. In addition, WTO members all participate actively in daily meetings held at the WTO headquarters in Geneva, and in Ministerial Conferences held every two years, most recently in Abu Dhabi in March 2024. Against this background, EU trade policy has remained attached to multilateralism and global trade rules, but has had to adjust with a grain of realism. This has meant the continuation of its long-standing pursuit of free-trade agreements with bilateral and regional partners, but also a shift in attitude, with the adoption of an arsenal of unilateral, autonomous instruments.


=== SEGMENT 94 ===
[Summary: Despite ongoing difficulties at the WTO, the EU has actively pursued multilateral initiatives aimed at reforming the organization's rules and practices. These efforts include attempting to resolve the Appellate Body crisis, instigating the Trade Facilitation Agreement and the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement, and participating in all WTO plurilaterals. The EU has also promoted greater WTO involvement in discussions concerning the interplay between trade and industrial policy.]

**Multilateral initiatives**
Despite – or perhaps because of – the difficulties at the WTO, the EU has been very active in trying to forge consensus among WTO members on reform of WTO rules and practices. It has attempted to resolve the crisis of the Appellate Body, was one of the instigators of the Trade Facilitation Agreement and the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement, and has participated in all WTO plurilaterals and joint statement initiatives among sub-sets of WTO members. The EU has also promoted the greater involvement of the WTO in the discussion on the interplay between trade and industrial policy.

[Summary: The EU maintains the world's largest network of bilateral and regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), which recent efforts have sought to expand and update. Key developments include the entry into force of an FTA with New Zealand in 2024, the conclusion of updated agreements with Mexico, Chile, and Kenya, and the launch of new negotiations with Australia, India, and Indonesia. However, efforts to amend and ratify the signed but unratified FTA with the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) were unsuccessful.]

**Bilateral and regional measures**[^5]
The EU has the largest network of bilateral and regional FTAs in the world, which your predecessors sought to widen and deepen. They launched new FTA negotiations with Australia, India and Indonesia, but progress has been slow. An FTA was reached with New Zealand and entered into force in 2024. Updated agreements were also concluded (with Mexico) and ratified (with Chile and Kenya), or negotiated but not concluded (with South Korea and Singapore). Finally, there was a push, without success, to amend a signed but never ratified FTA with the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The EU has also concluded digital trade or sustainable investment facilitation agreements with some countries.

> Your predecessors launched new FTA negotiations, but progress has been slow


=== SEGMENT 96 ===
[Summary: In contrast to the EU's extensive FTA network, China and the US have been less active; China focused on implementing the RCEP agreement, while the Biden administration has avoided negotiating new FTAs, preferring partnership agreements like IPEF that currently lack a trade component. The EU's motivation for expanding its FTA network is primarily geopolitical, seeking to ensure security of foreign market access for exporters and reliable access to critical raw materials necessary for the green transition.]

By contrast, China and the US have far fewer FTAs and have been far less active than the EU in recent years. China was the engine behind the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement (signed in 2020 and implemented in 2022), which counts 14 Asia-Pacific members besides China. Under President Biden, the US has not negotiated new FTAs. However, his administration has concluded a number of partnership agreements with strategically important countries, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) with 13 Asia-Pacific countries. Neither the IPEF nor similar partnerships, however, have so far included a trade component.

A clear motivation for the recent expansion of the EU’s FTA network is the current geopolitical situation, which requires security of foreign market access for EU exporters at a time of uncertainty about the fate of the WTO system, and security of access to critical raw materials for EU buyers, especially in the context of the green transition.


=== SEGMENT 97 ===
[Summary: While the EU has always used unilateral trade measures, traditionally relying only on WTO-explicitly allowed instruments like anti-dumping and anti-subsidy, the first von der Leyen Commission significantly expanded this approach. This expansion included applying traditional instruments to new areas, such as imports of electrical vehicles from China, and introducing a vast array of new autonomous instruments. These new instruments are not explicitly allowed by WTO rules and were primarily designed in response to the current geopolitical situation and the green transition.]

**Unilateral measures**
Like other WTO members, the EU has always used unilateral trade measures to defend its interests, but before the first von der Leyen Commission, it only used trade defence instruments (mainly anti dumping and anti-subsidy) explicitly allowed by WTO rules.

The first von der Leyen Commission continued to use traditional trade defence instruments, but has gone further by applying them to new situations, such as imports of electrical vehicles from China. It has also innovated by introducing a vast array of new autonomous instruments, which are not explicitly allowed by WTO rules though they may (or not) be judged WTO-compatible if and when countries decide to launch WTO dispute settlement cases against the EU.

> The Commission has innovated by introducing new autonomous instruments that are not explicitly allowed by WTO rules

These new autonomous instruments, which were designed mainly in response to the current geopolitical situation and the green transition, fall into two broad categories:

1.  Tools designed to defend the EU against unf


=== SEGMENT 98 ===
[Summary: The new EU autonomous instruments are categorized into two groups: tools defending the EU against unfair practices (like the Anti-Coercion Instrument, aimed primarily at powerful countries such as China and the US) and instruments focused on reducing EU and global carbon emissions (such as CBAM and the Deforestation Regulation). Although these measures are generally not classified as trade instruments and were not centrally designed by trade commissioners, they are expected to have significant trade effects, potentially resulting in WTO disputes or retaliation, particularly impacting Global South countries regarding climate measures.]

air practices and aggressive unilateral actions by the EU’s trading and investment partners; these can be viewed as an extension of the EU’s trade defence instruments. The new autonomous instruments include the Foreign Investment Screening Mechanism, the Enforcement Regulation, the International Procurement Instrument, the Foreign Subsidies Regulation and the Anti-Coercion Instrument. Although these instruments are not country-specific, it is clear that they are mainly intended to protect the EU from unilateral actions by economically and politically powerful countries, including China and the US. 2. Instruments intended to reduce EU and global carbon emissions. Instruments in this category include the carbon border adjustment measure (CBAM), the Deforestation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115), and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. These instruments are also not country-specific, but in reality, they will mainly affect Global South countries, which account for two-thirds of current global carbon emissions – though far less on a per-capita basis. For the most part, these new EU autonomous instruments are not trade instruments per se nor did the trade commissioners during the first von der Leyen Commission play a central role in their design. Nonetheless, measures adopted using these instruments will have significant trade effects, potentially leading to WTO disputes or trade retaliation by affected countries.


=== SEGMENT 99 ===
[Summary: The primary challenge facing the EU Trade Commissioner is maintaining the EU's commitment to open markets and adherence to the multilateral rules-based trading system, despite potential political changes in the EU and US. This commitment is crucial because the EU is significantly more dependent on international trade than the United States, and it is necessary for developing and emerging countries to sustain their economic development through exports.]

## Challenges As EU trade commissioner, you will face three main challenges. The first will be to maintain the EU’s commitment to open markets at home and abroad by continuing to adhere to the multilateral rules-based trading system, despite looming political changes in the EU and US. This will not be easy, but it is crucial both for the EU, which is far more dependent on international trade than the United States, and for developing and emerging countries, which need to continue to export in order to develop their economies.


=== SEGMENT 100 ===
[Summary: The second major challenge for the EU Trade Commissioner involves the difficulty in signing and implementing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). This is evident as the EU-Canada CETA, signed in 2016, remains unratified by ten EU national parliaments, and negotiations with key emerging partners like India, Indonesia, and Mercosur have stalled. The core issue is that these assertive Global South countries resist incorporating EU values, mandated by the Lisbon Treaty, into trade agreements, forcing the EU to confront a trade-off between economic interests and values.]

The second challenge will be to continue being able to sign and implement FTAs with important trading partners. The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), signed in 2016, is still not ratified by ten EU national parliaments. More worryingly, trade negotiations with three large emerging partners – India, Indonesia and Mercosur – have hit a problem that goes far beyond the usual difficulty in trade negotiations, which is the need to find a compromise between what the EU wants from its partner and the market access it is willing to grant in exchange. These large countries from the Global South are increasingly assertive and unwilling to yield to EU demands mandated by the Lisbon Treaty that EU trade agreements “be guided” (Art. 21(1) of the Treaty on European Union) by EU values, which they may not necessarily share. There may, therefore, be a trade-off between geopolitical and economic interests, and values, which the EU will have to grapple with. > Large countries from the Global South are increasingly assertive and unwilling to yield to EU demands


=== SEGMENT 101 ===
[Summary: The third challenge facing the EU concerns the intersection of trade and climate, where autonomous instruments like CBAM are expected to generate increasing resentment from Global South countries. To mitigate potential trade clashes and ensure global climate cooperation, the EU must incorporate a development aspect into its climate and trade policy. Additionally, the EU should continue championing 'open strategic autonomy,' integrating resilience and self-reliance ('strategic') with its foundational free-trade policies ('open').]

The third challenge relates to the trade and climate issue. During the first von der Leyen Commission, the EU rightly made the green transition one of its strategic priorities. Although the new Commission may have to slow down the implementation of the European Green Deal, the need to meet the net zero emission target will not go away. This means that autonomous instruments such as CBAM will continue to be implemented and will create increasing resentment from Global South countries. Adding a development aspect to the trade and climate issue will therefore be essential to ensure avoidance of trade clashes with the Global South, and above all that they play their part in meeting global climate objectives. ## Recommendations **Champion open trade and multilateralism despite the headwinds** Champion open trade and multilateralism despite the headwinds. The first von der Leyen Commission rightly made ‘open strategic autonomy’ the centrepiece of its geopolitical strategy. The term reflects the EU’s desire to chart its own course on the global stage, shaping the world through leadership and engagement, while preserving EU interests and values. The term ‘strategic’ captures resilience, and to a necessary degree, self-reliance. ‘Open’ is the counterbalancing factor suggesting that free-trade policies will continue to be the bedrock of the EU approach. The two components of the strategy can and should be married together. There is no either/or dilemma. > Open strategic autonomy became the centrepiece of the EU’s geopolitical strategy


=== SEGMENT 102 ===
[Summary: The text argues that the EU must champion multilateralism and open strategic autonomy to prevent protectionism, especially since the US is unwilling and China is incapable of filling this global leadership role. The EU should prioritize fostering multilateral solutions in security and climate, using trade liberalization as a platform for broader cooperation, and must begin by reviving the WTO's adjudicatory function.]

Pursuing open strategic autonomy within a vibrant multilateral context is the appropriate insurance policy to avoid sliding towards protectionism. The EU should continue to be the champion of multilateralism. The US is unwilling to play this role, and China is incapable of doing so, so the EU must carry the flag of multilateralism and be the voice of reason at a time when global cooperation is necessary more than ever in recent history, including to fight climate change. **Continue to facilitate security and climate cooperation** The EU should continue strive to keep channels of communication open across all nations. Realising gains from continuing liberalisation of trade is the platform to better understand gains from cooperation in other fields, such as climate. The EU should assume the role of the instigator in this realm. There are two priority areas for it to take the lead in fostering multilateral solutions: security and climate. Another important area for the EU is digital trade. The unipolar world has been shown to be a fallacy. The question is what is the best forum to discuss conflicting views? Unilateral action has led and can lead again to a spiral of counter- and counter-counter measures. The world community has paid the price of similar behaviour a few times already. Redressing the WTO adjudicatory function is a priority, but it is only the starting point in the quest to revive multilateralism. > There are two priority areas for it to take the lead in fostering multilateral solutions: security and climate


=== SEGMENT 103 ===
[Summary: The resurgence of industrial policy, often based on national security, challenges existing WTO rules, particularly the outdated WTO Subsidies Agreement, leading to increased trade frictions. The EU should leverage its experience with state aid to propose a comprehensive WTO reform, including a new subsidies agreement. This new agreement should penalize cross-national subsidies and exempt certain categories, such as those designed to fight climate change.]

**Address geopolitical concerns with appropriate instruments** Industrial policy is making a return everywhere (for good and bad reasons), often on grounds of national security. This trend is difficult for WTO rules and practices to handle, given the sensitivity of the trading system towards legitimate security concerns. The WTO Subsidies Agreement is outdated and ill-conceived, and adjudication of national security-related concerns has led to increased trade frictions. **Push for WTO reform** The EU should propose a new WTO framework to address the role of state intervention amid geopolitical uncertainty. The EU’s long experience in dealing with state aid is unparalleled. Building on this experience, it should propose a new agreement on subsidies that punishes cross-national subsidies (something WTO current rules do not do, despite the considerable importance of global value chains in world trade) and exonerates from liability certain categories of subsidies, including some that seek to fight climate change.


=== SEGMENT 104 ===
[Summary: The EU possesses substantial experience managing the intersection of its common commercial policy and the 27 national security policies of its member states. While acknowledging global voices arguing against WTO involvement in national security scrutiny, the text asserts that scrutiny is vital to prevent protectionist abuse, though it should not necessarily involve judicialization. The EU should propose establishing a WTO Committee on National Security to handle related disputes through deliberation, focusing on the aims, means chosen, and availability of less-intrusive alternatives.]

The EU has also gained substantial experience in handling the interplay between its common commercial policy and the 27 national security policies of its member states. There are voices in the global community arguing against any involvement of the WTO in scrutinising national security invocations by its membership. This is not desirable because of the danger that what constitutes legitimate security concerns will be abused in the slant towards protectionism. But scrutiny should not necessarily entail judicialisation of national security-related disputes at the WTO. The EU should propose the establishment of a WTO Committee on National Security, where disagreements and disputes can be handled through deliberations seeking to answer questions like: What is the aim pursued? Why were the specific means chosen? Are alternative less-intrusive means reasonably available?


=== SEGMENT 105 ===
[Summary: The EU should maximize the leverage of its Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), potentially by conditioning trade benefits on commitments like non-aggression. When engaging with countries in the Global South, the EU must carefully balance its values and interests to avoid being perceived as imposing its values, suggesting the acceptance of transitions and offering financial assistance to help developing countries meet EU standards.]

**Maximise FTA leverage** The EU could also do the same and more through its FTAs. It could, for example, condition trade benefits on firm commitments to non-aggression. In addition, in relation to the potential trade off between economic and geopolitical interests and values, especially when dealing with countries in the Global South, the EU should tread carefully to avoid being perceived as wanting to impose its values on others, while continuing to maintain those values. To bridge the potential gap between the EU’s values and what partners may be willing to accept, the EU should consider what transitions it is ready to accept from its FTA partners before they can meet its standards, and what financial assistance it could provide to developing countries to help them meet those standards. Finding the narrow path that combines EU interests and values will be crucial to advance the important EU’s bilateral trade and investment agenda with countries in the Global South. > The EU should tread carefully to avoid being perceived as wanting to impose its values on others


=== SEGMENT 106 ===
[Summary: The EU is advised to resist trade coercion, particularly from China and the US, by utilizing its new autonomous instruments and adopting de-risking policies based on WTO rules. These policies include the potential for taxing exports of sensitive materials under specific WTO conditions or blocking exports on national security grounds. Additionally, the EU should foster less reliance on China for critical products and enforce multilateral trade rules to prevent Chinese export bans.]

**Resist coercion and adopt de-risking policies** Finally, the EU should not hold back from using its new autonomous instruments against China and the US, should they try to coerce the EU through trade. The EU can also use WTO rules to adopt policies aimed at de-risking trade. Taxing exports of sensitive material is always possible if the EU has made no WTO export tariff commitments, and the export duty is applied uniformly on all WTO members. An alternative is to block exports to certain members on national security grounds. Fostering less reliance on China for certain critical products is perhaps desirable and can be achieved using instruments other than trade policy. At the same time, enforcement of multilateral trade rules could help the EU (and others) avoid Chinese export bans on critical products. Assuming China

[Summary: If China imposes export taxes on certain products, the EU can challenge them by invoking China’s commitments in its WTO Protocol of Accession, which prohibits such taxes. If China uses lawful production quotas, it must manage them without discriminating between domestic and foreign buyers. This demonstrates that respecting WTO rules is compatible with achieving the EU's goal of open strategic autonomy.]

imposes export taxes on certain products, the EU could invoke China’s commitments in its WTO Protocol of Accession, which forbids such taxes. If, instead, China imposes (lawful) production quotas on certain products, it will have to manage them without discriminating between domestic and foreign buyers of those products.Hence, respect for WTO rules and the goal of open strategic autonomy can go hand-in-hand. > Respect for WTO rules and the goal of open strategic autonomy can go hand-in-hand


=== SEGMENT 108 ===
[Summary: The EU must include developing and emerging countries, which currently account for two-thirds of global carbon emissions, in climate change mitigation efforts. To address the trade-climate-development nexus, the EU should propose a joint framework, inspired by the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation. The text stresses that climate finance and financial assistance are far more crucial for achieving global decarbonization than the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is considered insufficient.]

**Address the trade-climate-development nexus with appropriate instruments** Including developing and emerging countries in the fight against climate change is indispensable; their current share of two-thirds of global carbon emissions will probably increase as their economic development advances. Inspired by the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation, the EU should propose a framework to address trade, climate and development jointly. The priorities for financing green infrastructure projects should be set jointly by donors and beneficiaries. The volume of carbon emissions should be a key consideration in establishing a hierarchy of beneficiaries. Monitoring of compliance with agreed parameters for financing should be a pre-condition for continuation of financing. Financial assistance is important not only to help acceptance of CBAM by developing countries. The fact is that CBAM is neither a sufficient ‘stick’ nor ‘carrot’ for the necessary domestic decarbonisation by most EU trading partners. It may be useful, but not more than that. Climate finance, including financial assistance, is far more important.

[Summary: The WTO is identified as the appropriate forum for discussing the modalities of the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and similar policies, stressing the need for an international agreement on the carbon content of traded products and climate policies in international trade. The EU is cautioned that CBAM risks being challenged at the WTO or triggering countermeasures, which could lead to a trade war detrimental to its objectives. Therefore, the EU should prioritize promoting international dialogue and agreement.]

**Coordinate CBAM-like policies** The WTO is also the right place to discuss the modalities of CBAM and similar schemes that other jurisdictions may introduce. In particular, there is a need for an international agreement on the carbon content of traded products and, more generally, on climate policies and international trade. With such an agreement, there is a risk that CBAM will be challenged at the WTO by some affected countries, or even that some of them adopt countermeasures against EU imports. We would caution the EU against fuelling such a trade war, which would be detrimental to both its trade and climate objectives. Instead, the EU should promote international dialogue and agreement.

[Summary: The analysis suggests that the EU must complement multilateral efforts regarding CBAM by engaging developing and emerging countries through bilateral or regional approaches. The EU should utilize its Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to incentivize trading partners to adopt greener production and domestic climate legislation. This strategy involves potentially conditioning trade benefits and financial assistance on meeting specific climate targets, necessitating greater coherence across EU trade, climate, and development policies.]

But CBAM cannot be addressed only at the multilateral level. The EU should also engage with developing and emerging countries in looking for bilateral or regional approaches to help them shift their production to greener alternatives. For instance, the EU could use its FTAs to incentivise its trading partners to take the fight against climate change more seriously, implement legislation domestically to this effect and propagate a cooperative culture. The EU could make the provision of trade benefits and financial assistance conditional on certain climate targets. Dealing effectively with the trade-climate-development nexus – at multilateral, regional, bilateral or even unilateral levels – will require greater coherence between EU trade, climate and development policies and therefore greater coordination with your colleagues in charge of these policies. > The EU could use its FTAs to incentivise trading partners to take the fight against climate change more seriously

[Summary: The analysis explicitly excludes the EU’s trading relationship with the United Kingdom. This exclusion is based on the fact that the current EU-UK trade agreement represents a significant step back from the UK’s previous membership in the EU customs union and single market, making it fundamentally different from standard EU trade agreements designed to open up trade.]

[^5]: We do not cover the EU’s trading relationship with the United Kingdom. The EU has a trade agreement with the UK, but it represents a step back from the UK’s previous membership of the EU customs union and single market, and is not comparable to EU trade agreements with other partners, which are aimed at opening up trade. --- ...
