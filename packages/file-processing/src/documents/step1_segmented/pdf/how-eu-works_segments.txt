## 1.1. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION

### 1.1.1. THE FIRST TREATIES

> The disastrous effects of the Second World War and the constant threat of an East-West confrontation meant that Franco-German reconciliation had become a top priority. The decision to pool the coal and steel industries of six European countries, brought into force by the Treaty of Paris in 1951, marked the first step towards European integration. The Treaties of Rome of 1957 strengthened the foundations of this integration, as well as the notion of a common future for the six European countries involved.


=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: The initial legal framework for European integration was established by the Treaty of Paris (1951), which created the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and set up its foundational institutions. This was followed by the Treaties of Rome (1957), which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom. While the ECSC Treaty expired in 2002 after 50 years, the Treaties of Rome were concluded for an unlimited period, granting them quasi-constitutional status. The six founding countries involved in these treaties were Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.]

**LEGAL BASIS**

- The Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), or Treaty of Paris, was signed on 18 April 1951 and came into force on 23 July 1952. For the first time, six European States agreed to work towards integration. This Treaty laid the foundations of the Community by setting up an executive known as the ‘High Authority’, a Parliamentary Assembly, a Council of Ministers, a Court of Justice and a Consultative Committee. The ECSC Treaty expired on 23 July 2002 at the end of the 50-year validity period laid down in Article 97. In accordance with the Protocol (No 37) annexed to the Treaties (the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), the net worth of the ECSC’s assets at the time of its dissolution was assigned to the Research Fund for Coal and Steel to finance research by Member States in sectors relating to the coal and steel industry.
- The Treaties establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC, otherwise known as ‘Euratom’), or the Treaties of Rome, were signed on 25 March 1957 and came into force on 1 January 1958. Unlike the ECSC Treaty, the Treaties of Rome were concluded ‘for an unlimited period’ (Article 240 of the EEC Treaty and Article 208 of the EAEC Treaty), which conferred quasi-constitutional status on them.
- The six founding countries were Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: The segment outlines the distinct objectives of the three founding European Communities: the ECSC was intended as the initial step towards a 'European Federation,' using the common coal and steel market as an experiment for broader political integration. The EEC aimed to establish a common market based on the four freedoms of movement (goods, persons, capital, and services), while Euratom focused on coordinating the supply of fissile materials and research into the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Overall, the Treaties shared the unified purpose that European states must cooperate to build a common future.]

**OBJECTIVES**

- The founders of the ECSC were clear about their intentions for the Treaty, namely that it was merely the first step towards a ‘European Federation’. The common coal and steel market was to be an experiment which could gradually be extended to other economic spheres, culminating in a political Europe.
- The aim of the European Economic Community was to establish a common market based on the four freedoms of movement (goods, persons, capital and services).
- The aim of Euratom was to coordinate the supply of fissile materials and the research programmes initiated or being prepared by Member States on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
- The preambles to the three Treaties reveal a unity of purpose behind the creation of the Communities, namely the conviction that the States of Europe must work together to build a common future as this alone will enable them to control their destiny.


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: The European Communities (ECSC, EEC, and Euratom) were established in response to the devastation of WWII and the need for Franco-German reconciliation amidst East-West confrontation, focusing initially on reorganizing strategic industries like steel. European integration is considered to have begun with the appeal made by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman on May 9, 1950, which led France, Italy, Germany, and the Benelux countries to sign the Treaty of Paris based on the principle of building solidarity through concrete achievements.]

**MAIN PRINCIPLES**

The European Communities (the ECSC, EEC and Euratom) were born of the desire for a united Europe, an idea which gradually took shape as a direct response to the events that had shattered the continent. In the wake of the Second World War, the strategic industries, in particular the steel industry, needed reorganising. The future of Europe, threatened by East-West confrontation, lay in Franco-German reconciliation.

The appeal made by Robert Schuman, the French Foreign Minister, on 9 May 1950 can be regarded as the starting point for European integration. At that time, the choice of coal and steel was highly symbolic: in the early 1950s, coal and steel were vital industries and the basis of a country’s power. In addition to the clear economic benefits, the pooling of French and German resources was intended to mark the end of the rivalry between the two countries. On 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman declared: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.’ It was on the basis of that principle that France, Italy, Germany and the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) signed the Treaty of Paris, which concentrated predominantly on ensuring:


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Paris established key economic principles for the coal and steel sectors, including free movement of goods and market monitoring. However, early attempts at military integration, specifically the European Defence Community (EDC), failed after the French National Assembly refused ratification in 1954. This failure prompted the Messina Conference (1955), which successfully led to the signing of the EEC and EAEC Treaties, establishing the European Economic Community with provisions for eliminating internal customs duties, creating a Common Customs Tariff, and setting up institutions like the European Social Fund and the European Investment Bank.]

- Free movement of goods and free access to sources of production;
- Permanent monitoring of the market to avoid distortions which could lead to the introduction of production quotas;
- Compliance with the rules of competition and the principle of price transparency;
- Support for modernisation and conversion of the coal and steel sectors.

Following the signing of the Treaty of Paris, and despite France being opposed to the re-establishment of a German national military force, René Pleven was giving thought to the formation of a European army. The European Defence Community (EDC), negotiated in 1952, was to have been accompanied by a Political Community (EPC). Both plans were shelved following the French National Assembly’s refusal to ratify the treaty on 30 August 1954.

Efforts to get the process of European integration under way again following the failure of the EDC took the form of specific proposals at the Messina Conference (in June 1955) on a customs union and atomic energy. They culminated in the signing of the EEC and EAEC Treaties.

The provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC Treaty, the Treaty of Rome) included:

- The elimination of customs duties between Member States;
- The establishment of an external Common Customs Tariff;
- The introduction of common policies for agriculture and transport;
- The creation of a European Social Fund;
- The establishment of a European Investment Bank;
- The development of closer relations between the Member States.

To achieve these objectives the EEC Treaty laid down guiding principles and set the framework for the legislative activities of t


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: The EEC Treaty established key common policies, including agriculture (Articles 38-43), transport, and commercial policy, aiming to create a common market guaranteeing the free movement of goods, workers, services, and capital. While the Euratom Treaty's ambitious goals for nuclear industry growth were scaled back due to national sensitivities, the institutional structure was unified. This unification was completed by the Merger Treaty of 8 April 1965, which established a Single Council and a Single Commission.]

he Community institutions. These involved common policies: the common agricultural policy (Articles 38 to 43), transport policy (Articles 74 and 75) and a common commercial policy (Articles 110 to 113).

The common market is intended to guarantee the free movement of goods and the mobility of factors of production (the free movement of workers and enterprises, the freedom to provide services and the free movement of capital).

The Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (The Euratom Treaty) had originally set highly ambitious objectives, including the ‘speedy establishment and growth of nuclear industries’. However, owing to the complex and sensitive nature of the nuclear sector, which touched on the vital interests of the Member States (defence and national independence), those ambitions had to be scaled back.

The Convention on certain institutions common to the European Communities, which was signed and entered into force at the same time as the Treaties of Rome, stipulated that the Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice would be common institutions. This Convention lapsed on 1 May 1999. All that remained was for the ‘Executives’ to be merged, so the Treaty establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities of 8 April 1965, known as the ‘Merger Treaty’, duly completed the process of unifying the institutions.


=== SEGMENT 9 ===
[Summary: Following the unification of institutions, the general EEC system established dominance over the sectoral communities (ECSC and EAEC). Key developments leading up to the Single European Act (SEA) included the creation of Community own resources, strengthening Parliament's budgetary powers, direct election of MEPs, and the establishment of the European Monetary System (EMS). The SEA, which entered into force in 1986, substantially altered the Treaty of Rome and bolstered integration by creating a large internal market.]

From then on, the EEC held sway over the sectoral communities, the ECSC, and the EAEC. This amounted to a victory for the general EEC system over the coexistence of organisations with sectoral competence, and an establishment of its institutions.

### 1.1.2. DEVELOPMENTS UP TO THE SINGLE EUROPEAN ACT

> The main developments of the early Treaties are related to the creation of Community own resources, the reinforcement of the budgetary powers of Parliament, election of MEPs by direct universal suffrage and the setting-up of the European Monetary System (EMS). The entry into force of the Single European Act in 1986, which substantially altered the Treaty of Rome, bolstered the notion of integration by creating a large internal market.


=== SEGMENT 10 ===
[Summary: The first stage of European integration, defined by the Treaty of Rome, saw the successful and early completion of the customs union by July 1968, alongside the establishment of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) in 1962. Initial institutional changes included the 1965 Merger Treaty, which unified the executive bodies and introduced a single budget, and the 1970 Council decision establishing the system of Community own resources.]

**MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIRST STAGE OF INTEGRATION**

Article 8 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC), also known as the Treaty of Rome, provided for the completion of a common market over a transitional period of 12 years, in three stages, ending on 31 December 1969. Its first aim, the customs union, was completed more quickly than expected. The transitional period for enlarging quotas and phasing out internal customs ended as early as 1 July 1968. Even so, at the end of the transitional period there were still major obstacles to freedom of movement. By then, the EEC had adopted a common external tariff for trade with non-EEC countries.

Creating a ‘Green Europe’ was another major project for European integration. The first regulations on the common agricultural policy (CAP) were adopted and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund was set up in 1962.

**FIRST TREATY AMENDMENTS**

**A. Improvements to the institutions**

The first institutional change came about with the Merger Treaty of 8 April 1965, which merged the executive bodies. This took effect in 1967, setting up a single Council and Commission of the European Communities (the European Coal and Steel Community, the EEC and the European Atomic Energy Community) and introducing the principle of a single budget.

**B. Own resources and budgetary powers**

The Council decision of 21 April 1970 on the replacement of financial contributions from Member States by the Communities’ own resources set up a system of Community own resources, replacing financial contributions by the Member States (1.4.1).


=== SEGMENT 11 ===
[Summary: This segment outlines key institutional reforms and the first major enlargements of the European Communities between 1970 and 1986. Institutional changes included granting the Parliament significant budgetary powers via the Treaties of Luxembourg (1970) and Brussels (1975), establishing the Court of Auditors, and introducing direct universal suffrage for Parliament elections in 1976. Membership expanded with the accession of the UK, Denmark, and Ireland in 1973, Greece in 1981, and Portugal and Spain in 1986.]

- The Treaty of Luxembourg of 22 April 1970 granted Parliament certain budgetary powers (1.3.1).
- The Treaty amending certain financial provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Economic Communities and of the Treaty establishing a single Council of the European Communities (the Treaty of Brussels) of 22 July 1975 gave Parliament the right to reject the budget and to grant the Commission a discharge for implementing the budget. The same Treaty set up the Court of Auditors, a body responsible for scrutinising the Community’s accounts and for financial management (1.3.12).

**C. Elections**

The Act of 20 September 1976 gave Parliament new legitimacy and authority by introducing election by direct universal suffrage (1.3.4). The 1976 Act was revised in 2002 to introduce the general principle of proportional representation and other framework provisions for national legislation on the European elections.

**D. Enlargement**

The UK joined the Community on 1 January 1973, together with Denmark and Ireland; the Norwegian people had voted against accession in a referendum. Greece became a member in 1981 and Portugal and Spain joined in 1986.


=== SEGMENT 12 ===
[Summary: Following the first round of enlargement, the EU addressed budgetary concerns through the 1979 European Council agreements and the 1984 Fontainebleau agreements, which introduced a mechanism to adjust financial burdens based on relative prosperity. Concurrently, efforts to achieve political union resurfaced in the early 1960s, culminating in the Fouchet Plan (1960-1962), which ultimately failed to gain acceptance, leading to the establishment of European Political Cooperation (EPC) as a substitute.]

**E. EU budget**

After the first round of enlargement, there were calls for greater budgetary rigour and reform of the CAP. The 1979 European Council reached agreement on a series of complementary measures. The 1984 Fontainebleau agreements produced a sustainable solution based on the principle that adjustments could be made to assist any Member State with a financial burden that was excessive in terms of its relative prosperity.

**PLANS FOR FURTHER INTEGRATION**

Building on the initial successes of the economic community, the aim of also uniting the Member States politically resurfaced in the early 1960s, despite the failure of the European Defence Community in August 1954.

**A. Failure of an attempt to achieve political union**

At the 1961 Bonn summit, the Heads of State or Government of the six founding Member States of the European Community asked an intergovernmental committee, chaired by French ambassador Christian Fouchet, to put forward proposals on the political status of a union of European peoples. The study committee tried in vain, on two occasions between 1960 and 1962, to present the Member States with a draft treaty that was acceptable to all, even though Fouchet based his plan on strict respect for the identity of the Member States, thus rejecting the federal option.

In the absence of a political community, its substitute took the form of European Political Cooperation, or EPC.


=== SEGMENT 13 ===
[Summary: The segment details two key historical events: the push for political unification initiated at The Hague summit in December 1969, which led to the Davignon report forming the basis of European Political Cooperation (EPC). It also describes the 1966 crisis, where France employed the 'empty chair' policy in opposition to the shift from unanimity to qualified majority voting in the Council. This crisis was ultimately resolved by the adoption of the Luxembourg Compromise.]

At the summit conference in The Hague in December 1969, the Heads of State or Government decided to look into the best way of making progress in the field of political unification. The Davignon report, adopted by the foreign ministers in October 1970 and subsequently elaborated on by further reports, formed the basis of EPC until the Single European Act (SEA) entered into force.

**B. The 1966 crisis**

A serious crisis arose when, at the third stage of the transition period, voting procedures in the Council were to change from the unanimity rule to qualified majority voting in a number of areas. France opposed a range of Commission proposals, which included measures for financing the CAP, and stopped attending the main Community meetings (the ‘empty chair’ policy). Eventually, agreement was reached on the Luxembourg Compromise (1.3.7), which stated that, when vital interests of one or more countries were at stake, members of the Council would endeavour to reach solutions that could be adopted by all while respecting their mutual interests.


=== SEGMENT 14 ===
[Summary: European 'summits' of Heads of State or Government gained importance by providing political guidance and resolving issues the Council of Ministers could not handle. Key meetings included The Hague (1969), which launched enlargement negotiations, and Fontainebleau (1974), which mandated the direct election of the European Parliament and established the European Council, set to meet three times a year. Additionally, the Bremen and Brussels European Councils in 1978 created the European Monetary System (EMS) to address monetary instability and align economic policies.]

**C. The increasing importance of European ‘summits’**

Though remaining outside the Community institutional context, the conferences of Heads of State or Government of the Member States started to provide political guidance and to settle the problems that the Council of Ministers could not handle. After early meetings in 1961 and 1967, the conferences took on increasing significance with the summit at The Hague on 1 and 2 December 1969, which allowed negotiations to begin on enlarging the Community and saw agreement on the Community finance system, and with the Fontainebleau summit (in December 1974), at which major political decisions were taken on the direct election of the European Parliament and the decision-taking procedure within the Council. At that summit, the Heads of State or Government also decided to meet three times a year as the ‘European Council’ to discuss Community affairs and political cooperation (1.3.6).

**D. Institutional reform and monetary policy**

Towards the end of the 1970s, there were various initiatives in the Member States to bring their economic and fiscal policies into line with each other. To solve the problem of monetary instability and its adverse effects on the CAP and cohesion between Member States, the Bremen and Brussels European Councils in 1978 set up the EMS. Established on a voluntary and differentiated basis – the UK decided not to participate in the exchange-rate mechanism – the EMS was based on a common accounting unit, the European currency unit.


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: At the London European Council in 1981, German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Italian Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo proposed a 'European Act'. This proposal covered broad areas including political cooperation, culture, fundamental rights, and combating crime and terrorism. While the original proposal was not adopted, some of its elements were later included in the 'Solemn declaration on European Union' adopted in Stuttgart on 19 June 1983.]

At the London European Council in 1981, the Foreign Ministers of Germany and Italy, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Emilio Colombo, put forward a proposal for a ‘European Act’ covering a range of subjects: political cooperation, culture, fundamental rights, harmonisation of the law outside the fields covered by the Community Treaties, and ways of dealing with violence, terrorism and crime. It was not adopted in its original form, but some parts of it resurfaced in the ‘Solemn declaration on European Union’ adopted in Stuttgart on 19 June 1983.

**E. The Spinelli project**

A few months after its first direct election in 1979, Parliament’s relations with the Council were thrown into a serious crisis by the budget for 1980. At the instigation of Altiero Spinelli, MEP, founder of the European Federalist Movement and a former commissioner, a group of nine MEPs met in July 1980 to discuss ways of revitali


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: The segment details the 'Spinelli project,' where the European Parliament adopted a draft treaty for a European Union constitution on February 14, 1984, proposing a federal-style bicameral system, though it was ultimately rejected by Member States. Following this, the European Council established the Dooge Committee in June 1984 to propose institutional improvements. This led to the June 1985 Milan European Council decision to convene an intergovernmental conference aimed at strengthening institutional powers and establishing a genuine internal market.]

sing the operation of the institutions. In July 1981, Parliament set up an institutional affairs committee, with Spinelli as its coordinating rapporteur, to draw up a plan for amending the existing Treaties. The committee decided to formulate plans for what was to become the constitution of the European Union. The draft treaty was adopted by a large majority on 14 February 1984. Legislative power would come under a bicameral system akin to that of a federal state[1]. The system aimed to strike a balance between Parliament and the Council, but it was not acceptable to the Member States.

**THE SINGLE EUROPEAN ACT**

Having settled the Community budget dispute of the early 1980s, the European Council decided at its Fontainebleau meeting in June 1984 to set up an ad hoc committee of the personal representatives of the Heads of State or Government, named the Dooge Committee after its chairman. The committee was asked to make proposals for improving the functioning of the Community system and of political cooperation. The June 1985 Milan European Council decided by a majority (seven votes to three), in an exceptional procedure for that body, to convene an intergovernmental conference to consider strengthening the powers of the institutions, extending Community activities to new areas and establishing a ‘genuine’ internal market.


=== SEGMENT 17 ===
[Summary: The Single European Act (SEA) was signed by nine Member States on February 17, 1986, with the remaining three signing later that month. Although ratified in 1986, its entry into force was delayed until July 1, 1987, making it the first substantial change to the Treaty of Rome. The SEA significantly extended the Union's powers, notably by mandating the creation of a fully operational internal market by January 1, 1993, and establishing new competencies in areas such as monetary policy, social policy, and the environment.]

On 17 February 1986, nine Member States signed the SEA, followed later, on 28 February 1986, by Denmark (after a referendum vote in favour), Italy and Greece. The SEA was ratified by the Member States’ parliaments in 1986, but, because a private citizen had appealed to the Irish courts, its entry into force was delayed for six months until 1 July 1987. The SEA was the first substantial change to the Treaty of Rome. Its principal provisions were as follows:

**A. Extension of the Union’s powers**

1. Through the creation of a large internal market

A fully operational internal market was to be completed by 1 January 1993, taking up and broadening the objective of the common market introduced in 1958 (2.1.1).

2. Through the establishment of new powers as regards:
    - Monetary policy;
    - Social policy;
    - Economic and social cohesion;
    - Research and technological development;
    - The environment;
    - Cooperation in the field of foreign policy.


=== SEGMENT 18 ===
[Summary: The Single European Act (SEA) significantly improved the decision-making capacity of the Council of Ministers by replacing unanimity with Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) in four existing policy areas and introducing QMV for several new areas, such as the internal market and environmental policy. Concurrently, the SEA strengthened the European Parliament's role by requiring its assent for enlargement and association agreements and by introducing the cooperation procedure, which granted Parliament limited but genuine legislative powers, marking it as a step toward becoming a co-legislator.]

**B. Improvement in the decision-making capacity of the Council of Ministers**

Qualified majority voting replaced unanimity in four of the Community’s existing areas of responsibility (amendment of the common customs tariff, freedom to provide services, the free movement of capital and the common sea and air transport policy). Qualified majority voting was also introduced for several new areas of responsibility, such as the internal market, social policy, economic and social cohesion, research and technological development, and environmental policy. Finally, qualified majority voting was the subject of an amendment to the Council’s internal rules of procedure, so as to comply with a previous presidency declaration that, in future, the Council could be called upon to vote not only on the initiative of its president, but also at the request of the Commission or a Member State if a simple majority of the Council’s members were in favour.

**C. Growth of the role of the European Parliament**

Parliament’s powers were strengthened by:

- Making Community agreements on enlargement and association agreements subject to Parliament’s assent;
- Introducing a procedure for cooperation with the Council (1.2.3), which gave Parliament real, albeit limited, legislative powers; it applied to about a dozen legal bases at the time and marked a watershed in turning Parliament into a genuine co-legislator.

[Summary: The segment introduces the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, detailing their primary effects on the European Union structure. The Maastricht Treaty established the EU based on three pillars (European Communities, CFSP, and JHI) and was signed on February 7, 1992, entering into force on November 1, 1993. The Amsterdam Treaty subsequently made adjustments aimed at improving the Union's efficiency and democratic functioning in anticipation of enlargement.]

### 1.1.3. THE MAASTRICHT AND AMSTERDAM TREATIES

> The Maastricht Treaty altered the former European treaties and created a European Union based on three pillars: the European Communities, the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs (JHI). With a view to the enlargement of the Union, the Amsterdam Treaty made the adjustments needed to enable the Union to function more efficiently and democratically.

**THE MAASTRICHT TREATY**

The Treaty on European Union[1], signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992, entered into force on 1 November 1993.


=== SEGMENT 20 ===
[Summary: The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union, marking a new step toward an 'ever-closer union' and creating a single institutional structure. This structure included the Council, European Parliament, European Commission, Court of Justice, and Court of Auditors. Additionally, the Treaty established new bodies such as the advisory Economic and Social Committee and European Committee of the Regions, alongside the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank.]

**A. The Union’s structures**

By instituting a European Union, the Maastricht Treaty marked a new step in the process of creating an ‘ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe’. The Union was based on the European Communities and supported by policies and forms of cooperation provided for in the Treaty on European Union. It had a single institutional structure, consisting of the Council, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors which (being at the time strictly speaking the only EU institutions) exercised their powers in accordance with the Treaties. The Treaty established an Economic and Social Committee and a European Committee of the Regions, which both had advisory powers. A European System of Central Banks and a European Central Bank were set up under the provisions of the Treaty in addition to the existing financial institutions in the EIB group, namely the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund.


=== SEGMENT 21 ===
[Summary: The Maastricht Treaty organized the European Union's powers into a three-pillar structure: the first pillar was the European Communities, where Member States transferred sovereignty; the second was the common foreign and security policy (Title V); and the third was cooperation in justice and home affairs (Title VI). The latter two pillars primarily involved intergovernmental cooperation. The European Community (first pillar) was tasked with ensuring the single market functioned and promoting objectives such as sustainable economic development, high employment, social protection, and gender equality, while adhering to the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.]

**B. The Union’s powers**

The Union created by the Maastricht Treaty was given certain powers by the Treaty, which were classified into three groups and were commonly referred to as ‘pillars’: the first pillar consisted of the European Communities and provided a framework enabling powers for which Member States had transferred sovereignty in areas governed by the Treaty to be exercised by the Community institutions. The second pillar was the common foreign and security policy laid down in Title V of the Treaty. The third pillar was cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs laid down in Title VI of the Treaty. Titles V and VI provided for intergovernmental cooperation using the common institutions, with certain supranational features such as involving the Commission and consulting Parliament.

1.  **The European Community (first pillar)**
    The Community’s task was to make the single market work and to promote, among other things, a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection and equality between men and women. The Community pursued these objectives, acting within the limits of its powers, by establishing a common market and related measures set out in Article 3 of the EC Treaty and by initiating the economic and single monetary policy referred to in Article 4. Community activities had to respect the principle of proportionality and, in areas that did not fall within its exclusive competence, the principle of subsidiarity (Article 5 of the EC Treaty).


=== SEGMENT 22 ===
[Summary: The second pillar, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), tasked the Union with defining and implementing policy through intergovernmental methods, focusing on safeguarding the Union's values, security, and independence, and promoting democracy and human rights internationally. The third pillar, Cooperation in the fields of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA), aimed to provide citizens with a high level of safety via common intergovernmental action. This pillar covered crucial areas including external border controls, combating serious crime (terrorism, drug trafficking, international fraud), judicial cooperation, the creation of Europol, controlling illegal immigration, and common asylum policy.]

2.  **The common foreign and security policy (CFSP) (second pillar)**
    The Union had the task of defining and implementing, by intergovernmental methods, a common foreign and security policy. The Member States were to support this policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity. Its objectives were: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter; to strengthen the security of the Union in all ways; to promote international cooperation; to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

3.  **Cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs (third pillar)**
    The Union’s objective was to develop common action in these areas by intergovernmental methods to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice. It covered the following areas:
    - Rules and the exercise of controls on crossing the Community’s external borders;
    - Combating terrorism, serious crime, drug trafficking and international fraud;
    - Judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters;
    - Creation of a European Police Office (Europol) with a system for exchanging information between national police forces;
    - Controlling illegal immigration;
    - Common asylum policy.


=== SEGMENT 23 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Amsterdam, signed in 1997 and effective in 1999, significantly increased the powers of the European Union, particularly by giving prominence to sustainable development and employment within the European Community (EC). Crucially, the Treaty transferred major areas like asylum, immigration, and judicial cooperation in civil matters from the intergovernmental third pillar to the EC's Community method, while also fully endorsing the Schengen Agreement. Additionally, it strengthened intergovernmental cooperation in police and judicial matters by defining precise tasks and creating a new directive-like legal instrument.]

**THE AMSTERDAM TREATY**

The Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related acts[2], signed in Amsterdam on 2 October 1997, entered into force on 1 May 1999.

**A. Increased powers for the Union**

1.  **European Community**
    With regard to objectives, special prominence was given to balanced and sustainable development and a high level of employment. A mechanism was set up to coordinate Member States’ policies on employment, and there was a possibility of some Community measures in this area. The Agreement on Social Policy was incorporated into the EC Treaty with some improvements (removal of the opt-out). The Community method now applied to some major areas which had hitherto come under the third pillar, such as asylum, immigration, crossing external borders, combating fraud, customs cooperation and judicial cooperation in civil matters, in addition to some of the cooperation under the Schengen Agreement, which the EU and Communities endorsed in full.

2.  **European Union**
    Intergovernmental cooperation in the areas of police and judicial cooperation was strengthened by defining objectives and precise tasks and creating a new legal instrument similar to a directive. The instruments of the common foreign and security policy were developed later, in particu


=== SEGMENT 24 ===
[Summary: The text segment concludes the discussion on strengthening the European Union's common foreign and security policy (CFSP) by detailing the creation of the 'common strategy' instrument, the 'Secretary-General of the Council responsible for the CFSP' office, and the 'Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit'. It then outlines the significant strengthening of the European Parliament's legislative role through the extension of the codecision procedure to 15 legal bases, establishing Parliament and the Council as co-legislators on a practically equal footing, though exceptions remained for agriculture and competition policy.]

lar by creating a new instrument, the common strategy, a new office, the ‘Secretary-General of the Council responsible for the CFSP’, and a new structure, the ‘Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit’.

**B. A stronger position for Parliament**

1.  **Legislative power**
    Under the codecision procedure, which was extended to the existing 15 legal bases under the EC Treaty, Parliament and the Council became co-legislators on a practically equal footing. With the exception of agriculture and competition policy, the codecision procedure applied to all the areas where the Council was permitted to take decisions by qualified majority. In four cases (Articles 18, 42 and 47 and Article 151 on cultural policy, which remained unchanged) the codecision procedure was combined with a requirement for a unanimous decision in the Council. The other legislative areas where unanimity was required were not subject to codecision.


=== SEGMENT 25 ===
[Summary: The Amsterdam Treaty strengthened the European Parliament's power of control by granting it the right to approve the nominated President of the Commission in advance, supplementing its existing power to approve the Commission as a body (Article 214). Furthermore, changes were made regarding the election and statute of Members of Parliament (MEPs). Specifically, the Community gained the power to adopt common principles for elections (Article 190) and a legal basis was established for adopting a single statute for MEPs, although provisions for developing European political parties remained absent.]

2.  **Power of control**
    As well as voting to approve the Commission as a body, Parliament also had a vote to approve in advance the person nominated as President of the future Commission (Article 214).

3.  **Election and statute of Members**
    With regard to the procedure for elections to Parliament by direct universal suffrage (Article 190 of the EC Treaty), the Community’s power to adopt common principles was added to the existing power to adopt a uniform procedure. A legal basis making it possible to adopt a single statute for MEPs was included in the same article. However, there was still no provision allowing measures to develop political parties at European level (cf. Article 191).


=== SEGMENT 26 ===
[Summary: The Amsterdam Treaty introduced general provisions for "Closer Cooperation," allowing subsets of Member States to use common institutions for deeper integration, primarily in the third pillar and non-exclusive Community competence areas, under the condition that it would remain exceptional and only move integration forward. Furthermore, the Treaty simplified the existing texts by removing obsolete provisions and renumbering the articles, although it was ratified as amendments to the existing Treaties.]

**C. Closer cooperation**

For the first time, the Treaties contained general provisions allowing some Member States under certain conditions to take advantage of common institutions to organise closer cooperation between themselves. This option was in addition to the closer cooperation covered by specific provisions, such as economic and monetary union, creation of the area of freedom, security and justice and incorporating the Schengen provisions. The areas where closer cooperation was possible were the third pillar and, under particularly restrictive conditions, matters subject to non-exclusive Community competence. The conditions which any closer cooperation had to fulfil and the planned decision-making procedures had been drawn up in such a way as to ensure that this new factor in the process of integration would remain exceptional and, at all events, could only be used to move further towards integration and not to take retrograde steps.

**D. Simplification**

The Amsterdam Treaty removed from the European Treaties all provisions that the passage of time had rendered void or obsolete, while ensuring that this did not affect the legal effects derived from them in the past. It also renumbered the Treaty articles. For legal and political reasons the Treaty was signed and submitted for ratification in the form of amendments to the existing Treaties.


=== SEGMENT 27 ===
[Summary: The Amsterdam Treaty introduced institutional reforms aimed at preparing the EU for enlargement, including setting the maximum number of Members of the European Parliament at 700 (Article 189). The Treaty also included a Protocol addressing the composition of the Commission and weighted votes, mandating a comprehensive institutional review before the 21st Member State joined. Furthermore, while the Treaty expanded the use of qualified majority voting (QMV) for new legal bases, among existing Community policies, only research policy received new QMV provisions.]

**E. Institutional reforms with a view to enlargement**

1.  The Amsterdam Treaty set the maximum number of Members of the European Parliament, in line with Parliament’s request, at 700 (Article 189).
2.  The composition of the Commission and the question of weighted votes were covered by a ‘Protocol on the Institutions’ attached to the Treaty. This provided that, in a Union of up to 20 Member States, the Commission would comprise one national of each Member State, provided that by that date, weighting of the votes in the Council had been modified. At all events, at least a year before the 21st Member State joined, a new intergovernmental conference would have to comprehensively review the Treaties’ provisions on the institutions.
3.  There was provision for the Council to use qualified majority voting in a number of the legal bases newly established by the Amsterdam Treaty. However, of the existing Community policies, only research policy had new provisions on qualified majority voting, with other policies still requiring unanimity.


=== SEGMENT 28 ===
[Summary: The segment addresses miscellaneous institutional matters, focusing on transparency and the role of the European Parliament (EP). Transparency was enhanced through a protocol on subsidiarity implementation and new provisions granting access to documents (Article 255) and increasing openness in the Council's legislative work (Article 207(3)). Furthermore, the European Parliament maintained a consultative role before Intergovernmental Conferences (IGCs) were called and was actively involved in the IGCs, typically represented by its President or two members.]

**F. Other matters**

A protocol covered Community procedures for implementing the principle of subsidiarity. New provisions on access to documents (Article 255) and greater openness in the Council’s legislative work (Article 207(3)) improved transparency.

**ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT**

The European Parliament was consulted before an intergovernmental conference was called. Parliament was also involved in the intergovernmental conferences according to ad hoc formulas; during the last three it was represented, depending on the case, by its President or by two of its Members.

This fact sheet was prepared by the European Parliament’s Policy Department for Justice, Civil Liberties and Institutional Affairs.

=== SEGMENT 29 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Nice, signed on 26 February 2001 and entering into force on 1 February 2003, only partially prepared the EU for the significant enlargements that occurred in 2004 and 2007. Consequently, the Laeken European Council established the European Convention on the Future of Europe in December 2001 to draft a new legal basis in the form of a treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. This constitutional treaty ultimately failed to be ratified after receiving 'no' votes in referendums held in two Member States.]

### 1.1.4. THE TREATY OF NICE AND THE CONVENTION ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE

> The Treaty of Nice only partially prepared the EU for its significant enlargements to the east and south on 1 May 2004 and 1 January 2007. Therefore, as part of the conclusions to the Laeken European Council meeting in December 2001, EU leaders established the European Convention on the Future of Europe – an effort to produce a new legal basis for the EU in the form of a treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. Following ‘no’ votes in referendums in two of the Member States, this treaty was not ratified.

**TREATY OF NICE**

The Treaty of Nice, which amended the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related acts, was signed on 26 February 2001 and entered into force on 1 February 2003.


=== SEGMENT 30 ===
[Summary: The primary objective of the Treaty of Nice was to increase the efficiency and legitimacy of EU institutions and prepare the Union for its next major enlargement. This necessity arose from the December 1999 Helsinki European Council requirement that the EU be ready to welcome new Member States by the end of 2002. The enlargement presented institutional challenges because most applicant countries had smaller populations, which was expected to considerably increase the political weight of smaller countries within the EU.]

**A. Objectives**

The conclusions of the December 1999 Helsinki European Council meeting required that the EU be able, by the end of 2002, to welcome as new Member States the applicant countries that were ready for accession. Since only two of the applicant countries were more populous than the Member State average at the time, this meant that the political weight of countries with smaller populations was due to increase considerably. The Treaty of Nice was therefore meant to increase the efficiency and legitimacy of the EU institutions and to prepare the EU for its next major enlargement.


=== SEGMENT 31 ===
[Summary: The background for the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) was the failure of previous IGCs (Maastricht 1992 and Amsterdam 1997) to satisfactorily resolve key institutional issues, which became known as the ‘Amsterdam leftovers’. These unresolved issues included the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the extension of qualified majority voting. Consequently, the Helsinki European Council decided in December 1999 to convene a new IGC to address these matters and prepare the EU for enlargement.]

**B. Background**

A number of institutional issues had been addressed by the EU intergovernmental conferences (IGCs) of Maastricht in 1992 and Amsterdam in 1997, but were not yet satisfactorily resolved. These issues, which became known as the ‘Amsterdam leftovers’, included the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the extension of qualified majority voting. On the basis of a report by the Finnish Council Presidency, the Helsinki European Council decided at its December 1999 meeting that an IGC should deal with these ‘leftovers’ and all other changes required in preparation for the enlargement.


=== SEGMENT 32 ===
[Summary: The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) opened on February 14, 2000, and concluded its work in Nice on December 10, 2000, reaching agreement on institutional questions and several other points. These agreements included a new distribution of seats in the European Parliament, arrangements for enhanced cooperation, monitoring of fundamental rights, and strengthening the EU judicial system. The IGC determined that its main imperative was changing the relative weighting of Member States’ votes in the Council, a subject not addressed by an IGC since 1956-1957.]

**C. Content**

The resulting IGC opened on 14 February 2000 and completed its work in Nice on 10 December 2000, reaching agreement on the institutional questions and on a range of other points, namely a new distribution of seats in the European Parliament, more flexible arrangements for enhanced cooperation, the monitoring of fundamental rights and values in the EU, and a strengthening of the EU judicial system.

1.  **Weighting of votes in the Council**
    Taking together the system of voting in the Council, the composition of the Commission and, to some extent, the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, the 2000 IGC concluded that the main imperative was to change the relative weighting of the Member States’ votes in the Council – a subject no other IGC had addressed since that of 1956-1957, which had led to the Treaty of Rome.


=== SEGMENT 33 ===
[Summary: The IGC addressed the definition of a qualified majority, considering either a new weighting system or a dual majority (votes and population), ultimately choosing the former despite the Commission and Parliament favoring the latter. This new system increased the total number of votes but reduced the relative share held by the most populous Member States, which fell to 44.5% by 2007. Additionally, a demographic 'safety net' was introduced, allowing any Member State to request verification that the qualified majority represents at least 62% of the total EU population, failing which the decision cannot be adopted.]

Two methods of defining a qualified majority were considered: a new system of weighting (modifying the existing one) or the application of a dual majority (of votes and of population) – the latter solution having been proposed by the Commission and endorsed by Parliament. The IGC chose the first option. The number of votes was increased for all Member States, but the share accounted for by the most populous Member States decreased: previously 55% of votes, this fell to 45% when the 10 new members joined in 2004, and to 44.5% on 1 January 2007. These changes were accompanied by the introduction of a demographic ‘safety net’: a Member State may request verification that the qualified majority represents at least 62% of the total population of the EU. If it does not, the decision subject to the vote cannot be adopted.


=== SEGMENT 34 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Nice introduced changes to the composition and internal organization of the European Commission. Regarding composition, since 2005, the College of Commissioners has included one Commissioner per Member State, though the Council can unanimously decide on the number and establish a rotation system. Internally, the Treaty empowered the Commission President to allocate and reassign Commissioner responsibilities and to select and determine the number of Vice-Presidents.]

2.  **The Commission**
    a.  **Composition**
        Since 2005, as stipulated by the Treaty of Nice, the Commission’s College of Commissioners has comprised one Commissioner per Member State. The Council has the power to decide, acting unanimously, on the number of Commissioners and on arrangements for a Member State rotation system, ensuring that each College of Commissioners reflects the demographic and geographical range of the Member States.
    
    b.  **Internal organisation**
        The Treaty of Nice provides the President of the Commission with the power to allocate responsibilities to the Commissioners and to reassign them during his or her term of office, as well as to select and determine the number of Vice-Presidents.


=== SEGMENT 35 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Nice revised the composition of the European Parliament, increasing the maximum number of MEPs from 700 (set by the Treaty of Amsterdam) to 732, partly to prepare for enlargement and counterbalance changes in Council voting weights. Additionally, the Treaty enhanced Parliament's powers by enabling it to bring legal challenges against acts of the Council, the Commission, or the European Central Bank.]

3.  **The European Parliament**
    a.  **Composition**
        The Treaty of Amsterdam had set the maximum number of MEPs at 700. In developing the Treaty of Nice, the European Council thought it necessary, with an eye to enlargement, to revise the number of MEPs for each Member State. The new composition of Parliament was also used to counterbalance the altered weighting of votes in the Council. The maximum number of MEPs was therefore set at 732.
    
    b.  **Powers**
        Parliament was enabled, as were the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to bring a legal ch


=== SEGMENT 36 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Nice significantly expanded the European Parliament's powers, granting it the ability to bring legal challenges against acts of the Council, the Commission, or the European Central Bank on grounds including lack of competence or misuse of powers. Legislatively, Parliament's role increased through a slight broadening of the co-decision procedure and the requirement of its assent for enhanced cooperation in co-decision areas. Furthermore, the Treaty amended Article 191 TEU to establish the legal basis for adopting regulations concerning EU political parties and their funding under the co-decision procedure.]

allenge to acts of the main decision-makers leading the EU’s administration – in Parliament’s case, the Council or the Commission – or the European Central Bank on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaties or of any rule of law matter relating to its application, or misuse of powers.        Further to a proposal by the Commission, the Treaty of Nice amended Article 191 TEU to form the operational legal basis for the adoption, under the co-decision procedure, of regulations governing political parties at EU level and rules on their funding.        Parliament’s legislative powers were increased through a slight broadening of the scope of the co-decision procedure and by requiring Parliament’s assent for the establishment of enhanced cooperation in areas covered by co-decision. Parliament must also be asked for its opinion should the Council adopt a position on the risk of a serious breach of fundamental rights in a Member State.


=== SEGMENT 37 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Nice reformed the EU's judicial system by empowering the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) to sit in various configurations, including chambers and a Grand Chamber, and by increasing the powers of the General Court to handle certain preliminary rulings. Regarding legislative procedures, the Treaty significantly expanded qualified majority voting (QMV) to 27 new policies and measures in the Council, though the extension of the co-decision procedure was limited to only a few minor areas.]

4.  **Reform of the judicial system**    a.  **The Court of Justice of the EU**        The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) was empowered by the Treaty of Nice to sit in a number of different configurations: in chambers (where it consists of three or five judges), in a Grand Chamber (11 judges) or as the full Court. The Council, acting unanimously, may increase the number of Advocates-General. The CJEU retained jurisdiction over questions referred for a preliminary ruling, but it was enabled, under its Statute, to refer an increased range of actions or proceedings to the General Court – which, before the December 2009 entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, was the Court of First Instance.    b.  **General Court**        The powers of the General Court were increased to include certain categories of preliminary ruling, with the possibility of judicial panels being established by unanimous decision of the Council. All these operating provisions, notably on the powers of the Court, were thereafter set out in the amended Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC).5.  **Legislative procedures**    Although a considerable number (27) of new policies and measures now required qualified majority voting in the Council, co-decision was extended to only a few minor areas (covered by former Articles 13, 62, 63, 65, 157, 159 and 191 TEC); for matters covered by former Article 161 TEC assent was now required.


=== SEGMENT 38 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Nice significantly expanded the scope of enhanced cooperation, extending it to cover all three EU pillars (European Communities, CFSP, and JHA), unlike the Treaty of Amsterdam, and introduced new procedural requirements, such as requiring Parliament's assent in certain co-decision areas. Additionally, the Treaty strengthened fundamental rights protection by amending Article 7 TEU to address the 'clear risk' of a breach and formally proclaimed the non-binding Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.]

6.  **Enhanced cooperation**    Like the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Treaty of Nice contained general provisions applying to all areas of enhanced cooperation and provisions specific to each of the three EU ‘pillars’ – or competencies – established by the Treaty of Maastricht: the European Communities pillar, the Common Foreign and Security pillar, and the Justice and Home Affairs pillar. Whereas the Treaty of Amsterdam provided for enhanced cooperation under the first and third pillars only, the Treaty of Nice encompassed all three pillars.    The Treaty of Nice made further changes: referral to the European Council ceased to be an option, the concept of ‘a reasonable period of time’ was clarified, and the assent of Parliament was now required in all areas where enhanced cooperation related to a question covered by the co-decision procedure.7.  **Protection of fundamental rights**    The Treaty of Nice added a paragraph to Article 7 TEU to cover cases where a patent breach of fundamental rights has not actually occurred but where there is a ‘clear risk’ that it may occur. The Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members and after obtaining the assent of Parliament, determines the existence of the risk and addresses appropriate recommendations to the Member State in question. A non-binding Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was proclaimed.


=== SEGMENT 39 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament actively participated in preparations for the 2000 IGC, issuing resolutions and insisting on a transparent process that would result in a constitution-type document. Subsequently, the Laeken European Council, based on Declaration No 23 of the Treaty of Nice, established the Convention on the Future of Europe in December 2001. The Convention's primary goals were to prepare transparently for the next IGC and address major issues, including competence division, instrument simplification, improving democracy and efficiency, and drafting a constitution for EU citizens.]

**D. Role of the European Parliament**As with earlier IGCs, Parliament was actively involved in preparations for the IGC held in 2000. In its resolutions of 18 November 1999 on the preparation of the reform of the Treaties and the next Intergovernmental Conference and its resolution of 31 May 2001 on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union, it provided its views on the conference agenda and its progress and objectives. Parliament also expressed its opinion on the substance and judicial implications of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Parliament insisted that the 2000 IGC should be a transparent process, involving European and national parliamentarians and the Commission, as well as input from ordinary people, and that what it produced should be a constitution-type document.**CONVENTION ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE****A. Basis and objectives**In accordance with Declaration No 23 annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Laeken European Council meeting of 14 and 15 December 2001 decided to organise the Convention on the Future of Europe to bring together the main parties concerned for debates and discussions on the future of the EU. The objectives were to prepare for the next IGC as transparently as possible, and to address the four main issues concerning the further development of the EU: a better division of competences; the simplification of the EU’s instruments for action; increased democracy, transparency and efficiency; and the drafting of a constitution for the EU’s citizens.


=== SEGMENT 40 ===
[Summary: The Convention on the Future of Europe was structured with 105 members, including representatives from national governments, parliaments, the European Parliament, and the Commission, and was chaired by Valéry Giscard D’Estaing. Its work involved a 'listening phase,' a study phase, and a drafting phase, guided by its Praesidium. This process culminated in the drawing up and debate of the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe during the first half of 2003.]

**B. Organisation**The Convention comprised a chair (Valéry Giscard D’Estaing), two vice-chairs (Giuliano Amato and Jean-Luc Dehaene), 15 representatives of the Member States’ heads of state or government, 30 members of the national parliaments (two per Member State), 16 Members of the European Parliament and two Commissioners. The countries that had applied to join the EU also took part in the debate on an equal footing, but could not block any consensus that might emerge among the Member States. The Convention therefore had a total of 105 members.The Convention was guided by its Praesidium, comprising, in addition to the chair and vice-chairs, nine members of the Convention and an invited representative chosen by the applicant countries. The Praesidium had the role of lending impetus to the Convention and providing it with a basis on which to work.**C. Outcome**The work of the Convention on the Future of Europe comprised: a ‘listening phase’, in which it sought to identify the expectations and needs of the Member States and the EU’s citizens; a phase in which the ideas expressed were studied; and a phase in which recommendations based on the essence of the debate were drafted. At the end of 2002, 11 working groups presented their findings to the Convention. During the first half of 2003, the Convention drew up and debated a text which became the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.


=== SEGMENT 41 ===
[Summary: The draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was presented in four parts throughout mid-2003 and subsequently adopted by the European Council in June 2004 and approved by the European Parliament in January 2005. However, the ratification process failed after the treaty was rejected in national referendums in France (May 2005) and the Netherlands (June 2005). Separately, the European Parliament played a decisive role in the Convention on the Future of Europe, influencing the debates and achieving many aims that were later incorporated into the Treaty of Lisbon.]

Part I of the draft Treaty (59 articles) and Part II (Charter of Fundamental Rights; 54 articles) were laid before the Thessaloniki European Council on 20 June 2003. Part III (policies and functioning; 342 articles) and Part IV (general and final provisions; 10 articles) were presented to the Italian Presidency on 18 July 2003. The European Council adopted this text on 18 June 2004, retaining the basic structure of the Convention’s draft, albeit with a considerable number of amendments. The proposed treaty was approved by the European Parliament in January 2005, but was then rejected by France (29 May 2005) and the Netherlands (1 June 2005) in their national referendums. As a result of two ‘no’ votes in referendums in two of the Member States, the ratification procedure for the treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was not completed.**D. Role of the European Parliament**The impact of MEPs during the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe was seen by most observers as decisive. Thanks to several factors, including their experience of negotiating in an international environment and the fact that the Convention was meeting on Parliament’s premises, MEPs were able to leave a strong imprint on the debates and on the proceedings of the Convention. They were also instrumental in the formation of political families comprising MEPs and national MPs. Parliament thus achieved a considerable number of its original aims, and most of that achievement is now safeguarded in the Treaty of Lisbon.

[Summary: This segment introduces a fact sheet on the Treaty of Lisbon, outlining its legal basis and historical development. The Treaty, which entered into force on December 1, 2009, emerged from a constitutional project initiated in 2001 and was necessitated by the failure of the Constitutional Treaty following negative referendums in 2005. This led to a 'period of reflection' and ultimately resulted in the adoption of a mandate for an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in June 2007, which concluded its work in October 2007.]

The process leading to the Treaty of Lisbon is a result of the negative outcome of two referendums on the Constitutional Treaty in May and June 2005, in response to which the European Council decided to have a two-year ‘period of reflection’. Finally, on the basis of the Berlin Declaration of March 2007, the European Council of 21 to 23 June 2007 adopted a detailed mandate for a subsequent Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), under the Portuguese Presidency. The IGC concluded its work in Octob


=== SEGMENT 43 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon was signed in Lisbon on December 13, 2007, and subsequently ratified by all Member States. It renamed the Treaty establishing the European Community to the 'Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union' (TFEU), making the Union the legal successor to the Community. Although it transferred no additional exclusive competences, the Treaty reformed the exercise of existing powers by enhancing citizens' participation, creating a new institutional set-up, and increasing parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability.]

er 2007. The Treaty was signed by the European Council in Lisbon on 13 December 2007 and has been ratified by all Member States.

**CONTENT**

**A. Objectives and legal principles**

The Treaty establishing the European Community is renamed the ‘Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union’ (TFEU) and the term ‘Community’ is replaced by ‘Union’ throughout the text. The Union takes the place of the Community and is its legal successor. The Treaty of Lisbon does not create state-like Union symbols like a flag or an anthem. Although the new text is, hence, no longer a constitutional treaty by name, it preserves most of the substantial achievements.

No additional exclusive competences are transferred to the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon. However, it changes the way the Union exercises its existing powers and some new (shared) powers, by enhancing citizens’ participation and protection, creating a new institutional set-up and amending the decision-making processes for increased efficiency and transparency. It therefore brings a higher level of parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability.


=== SEGMENT 44 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon avoids formally enshrining the supremacy of Union law in an article, unlike the Constitutional Treaty, but confirms this principle via Declaration 17, which relies on established case-law from the Court of Justice of the European Union. Crucially, the Treaty clarifies the Union's powers for the first time by defining three types of competences—exclusive, shared, and supporting—and allows for Union competences to be returned to Member States during a Treaty revision.]

Unlike the Constitutional Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon contains no article formally enshrining the supremacy of Union law over national legislation. However, a declaration was attached to the Treaty to this effect (Declaration 17). It explains how EU law takes precedence over national law in accordance with well settled case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The Treaty of Lisbon clarifies the powers of the Union for the first time. It distinguishes between three types of competences: exclusive competence, where the Union alone can legislate, and Member States can only implement; shared competence, where the Member States can legislate and adopt legally binding measures if the Union has not done so; and supporting competence, where the EU adopts measures to support or complement Member States’ policies. Union competences can now be handed back to the Member States in the course of a Treaty revision.


=== SEGMENT 45 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon granted the EU full legal personality, allowing the Union to sign international treaties and join international organizations, while requiring Member States' agreements to be compatible with EU law. Crucially, the Treaty introduced Article 50 TEU, establishing the first formal procedure for Member States wishing to withdraw from the Union. Additionally, it completed the absorption of the remaining third pillar aspects, such as police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, into the first pillar.]

The Treaty of Lisbon gives the EU full legal personality. Therefore, the Union obtains the ability to sign international treaties in the areas of its attributed powers or to join an international organisation. Member States may only sign international agreements that are compatible with EU law.

For the first time, the Treaty provides for a formal procedure to be followed by Member States wishing to withdraw from the EU in accordance with their constitutional requirements, namely Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).

The Treaty of Lisbon completes the absorption of the remaining third pillar aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice, i.e. police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, into the first pillar.


=== SEGMENT 46 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon eliminated the former intergovernmental structure, replacing it with the ordinary legislative procedure, which uses qualified majority voting, codecision, and Community legal instruments like regulations and directives. The Treaty also empowered the European Parliament to propose amendments to the Treaties, aligning it with the Council, Member State governments, and the Commission. Treaty revision procedures typically involve a convention and an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), though simplified procedures are available for revisions concerning the Union's internal policies and actions.]

The former intergovernmental structure ceases to exist, as the acts adopted in this area are now made subject to the ordinary legislative procedure (qualified majority and codecision), using the legal instruments of the Community method (regulations, directives and decisions), unless otherwise specified.

With the Treaty of Lisbon in force, Parliament is able to propose amendments to the Treaties, as was already the case for the Council, a Member State government or the Commission. Normally, such an amendment would require the convocation of a convention which would recommend amendments to an IGC. The European Council could, however, decide not to hold such a convention, subject to Parliament’s consent (Article 48(3) TEU, second paragraph). An IGC could then be convened to determine amendments to the Treaties by common accord. It is, however, also possible to revise the Treaties without convening an IGC, as well as through simplified revision procedures, where the revision concerns the internal policies and actions of the Union (Article 48(6) and 48(7) TEU). The revision would then be adopted as a European Council decision but might remain subject to national ratification rules.


=== SEGMENT 47 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon enhanced democracy by expressing the fundamental principles of democratic equality, representative democracy, and participatory democracy, introducing the citizens' initiative as a new form of participation. It also strengthened the protection of fundamental rights by granting the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding status and the same legal value as the Treaties via Article 6(1) TEU.]

**B. Enhanced democracy and better protection of fundamental rights**

The Treaty of Lisbon expresses the three fundamental principles of democratic equality, representative democracy and participatory democracy. Participatory democracy takes the new form of a citizens’ initiative (4.1.5).

The Charter of Fundamental Rights is not incorporated directly into the Treaty of Lisbon, but acquires a legally binding character through Article 6(1) TEU, which gives the Charter the same legal value as the Treaties (4.1.2).


=== SEGMENT 48 ===
[Summary: The EU's process to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) began in 2010 following the entry into force of the 14th protocol, which allows international organizations to become signatories. Although an initial draft agreement was reached in 2013, it was subsequently deemed incompatible with Article 6 TEU by the CJEU in Opinion 2/13. Formal negotiations resumed in 2020, culminating in a provisional agreement on a revised draft accession agreement in March 2023.]

The process of the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was opened when the 14th protocol to the ECHR entered into force on 1 June 2010. This allows not only states but also an international organisation, i.e. the EU, to become signatories of the ECHR. Accession still requires ratification by all states that are parties to the ECHR, as well as by the EU itself. Negotiations between Council of Europe and EU representatives led to the finalisation of a draft agreement in April 2013, which, however, was deemed incompatible with Article 6 TEU by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in its Opinion 2/13. In October 2019, the Commission told the Council of Europe it was ready to restart negotiations. Formal negotiations resumed in October 2020, and the negotiators reached a provisional agreement on a revised draft accession agreement in March 2023.


=== SEGMENT 49 ===
[Summary: The revised draft agreement for the EU's accession to the ECHR addresses all concerns raised by the CJEU, except for jurisdiction over the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which the EU committed to resolving internally. Regarding institutional changes, the European Parliament's composition was redefined under Article 14(2) TEU to represent the Union's citizens. Additionally, Parliament's legislative powers were significantly increased by renaming the codecision procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure and expanding its scope to 85 policy areas, including over 40 new ones.]

The revised agreement covers all issues raised by the CJEU except one, concerning jurisdiction over the EU’s common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The EU has committed to resolving this issue internally[1].

**C. A new institutional set-up**

1.  **The European Parliament**
    Under Article 14(2) TEU, Parliament is now ‘composed of representatives of the Union’s citizens’, not of representatives of ‘the peoples of the States’.
    
    Parliament’s legislative powers have been increased, as the scope of the former codecision procedure, now renamed ‘ordinary legislative procedure’, was significantly enlarged. It now applies to more than 40 new policy areas, raising the total number to 85.


=== SEGMENT 50 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament's procedural powers include renaming the assent procedure to 'consent' and establishing full parity with the Council in the new budgetary procedure for approving the annual budget. Furthermore, Parliament now elects the President of the Commission based on a European Council proposal, which must be selected by a qualified majority (72% of Member States representing 65% of the EU population), and Parliament must also agree to the multiannual financial framework.]

The assent procedure continues to exist as ‘consent’, and the consultation procedure remains unchanged. The new budgetary procedure creates full parity between Parliament and the Council for approval of the annual budget. The multiannual financial framework has to be agreed by Parliament.
    
    Parliament now elects the President of the Commission by a majority of its members on a proposal from the European Council, which is obliged to select a candidate by qualified majority, taking into account the outcome of the European elections. That is, in this case, according to Article 238 (2) TFEU, the qualified majority refers to at least 72% of Member States representing at least 65% of the EU population. Parliament continues to approve the Commission as a college.


=== SEGMENT 51 ===
[Summary: The maximum number of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) was initially set at 751, operating under the principle of degressive proportionality, with seat allocations ranging from a maximum of 96 to a minimum of six per Member State. Following the UK's departure, Parliament voted on February 7, 2018, to reduce the total number of seats from 751 to 705. This change also involved re-distributing some of the freed-up seats to Member States that were slightly under-represented.]

The maximum number of MEPs has been set at 751, with citizens’ representation being degressively proportional. The maximum number of seats per Member State is reduced to 96, while the minimum number is increased to six. On 7 February 2018, Parliament voted in favour of reducing the number of its seats from 751 to 705 after the UK’s departure from the EU and re-distributing some of the seats thereby freed up among those Member States that were slightly under-represented (1.3.3).


=== SEGMENT 52 ===
[Summary: Following the UK's departure from the EU on 1 February 2020, the composition of the European Parliament was adjusted to 705 MEPs until the 10th parliamentary term began in 2024. Of the 73 seats vacated by the withdrawal, 27 were reallocated among 14 Member States, including France (+5) and Spain (+5), to better reflect the principle of degressive proportionality. This reallocation ensured that no existing Member State lost any seats.]

The UK left the EU on 1 February 2020. Between this date and the beginning of the 10th parliamentary term in 2024, the new composition of 705 MEPs was applied. Of the 73 seats vacated by the UK’s withdrawal, 27 seats have been reallocated to better reflect the principle of degressive proportionality: the 27 seats have been distributed to France (+5), Spain (+5), Italy (+3), the Netherlands (+3), Ireland (+2), Sweden (+1), Austria (+1), Denmark (+1), Finland (+1), Slovakia (+1), Croatia (+1), Estonia (+1), Poland (+1) and Romania (+1). No Member State has lost any seats.


=== SEGMENT 53 ===
[Summary: The European Council Decision (EU) 2023/2061 set the total number of representatives in the European Parliament for the 2024–2029 term at 720, based on recent demographic developments. This decision allocated 15 additional seats across twelve Member States, with France, Spain, and the Netherlands receiving two seats each. Furthermore, the Treaty of Lisbon formally recognizes the European Council as an EU institution responsible for establishing the Union's general political directions and priorities.]

European Council Decision (EU) 2023/2061[2] sets the number of representatives in Parliament – 720 in total – elected in each Member State for the 2024–2029 parliamentary term based on recent demographic developments. The 15 additional seats were allocated to France (+2), Spain (+2), the Netherlands (+2), Austria (+1), Denmark (+1), Belgium (+1), Poland (+1), Finland (+1), Slovakia (+1), Ireland (+1), Slovenia (+1) and Latvia (+1).

2.  **The European Council**
    The Treaty of Lisbon formally recognises the European Council as an EU institution, responsible for providing the Union with the ‘impetus necessary for its development’ and for establishing its ‘general political directions and priorities’.


=== SEGMENT 54 ===
[Summary: The European Council has no legislative functions and operates under a long-term presidency, replacing the previous six-month rotation system to improve continuity. The President is elected by a qualified majority for a once-renewable term of 30 months (two and a half years). This President is also responsible for representing the Union externally.]

The European Council has no legislative functions. A long-term presidency replaces the previous system of six-month rotation. A qualified majority of the European Council elects the President for a once-renewable term of 30 months (two and a half years). This should improve the continuity and coherence of the European Council’s work. The President also represents the Union externally, without prejudice to the duties of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (see below).


=== SEGMENT 55 ===
[Summary: The Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP / HR) is responsible for the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and is appointed by a qualified majority of the European Council with the agreement of the Commission President. The VP / HR chairs the Foreign Affairs Council, serves as a Vice-President of the Commission, and is assisted by the European External Action Service (EEAS). Separately, the Treaty of Lisbon maintains the principle of double majority voting (citizens and Member States) for the Council.]

3.  **The Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP / HR)**
    The VP / HR is appointed by a qualified majority of the European Council with the agreement of the President of the Commission and is responsible for the EU’s CFSP, and has the right to put forward proposals. Besides chairing the Foreign Affairs Council, the VP / HR also has the role of Vice-President of the Commission. The VP / HR is assisted by the European External Action Service, which comprises staff from the Council, the Commission and national diplomatic services.

4.  **The Council**
    The Treaty of Lisbon maintains the principle of double majority voting (citizens and Member States). However, the previous arrangements remained in place until November


=== SEGMENT 56 ===
[Summary: The new qualified majority voting rules for the Council, implemented since November 1, 2014, require 55% of members representing 65% of the population to pass a standard proposal. The Council meets publicly when dealing with legislative acts and utilizes a six-month rotating presidency, supplemented by 18-month group presidencies to ensure continuity, though the Foreign Affairs Council is continuously chaired by the VP/HR.]

2014. Since 1 November 2014, the new rules have applied.
    
    A qualified majority is reached when 55% of members of the Council (in practice, 15 states out of 27), comprising at least 65% of the population, support a proposal (Article 16(4) TEU). When the Council is not acting on a proposal from the Commission or the VP / HR, the necessary majority of Member States increases to 72% (Article 238(2) TFEU). To block legislation, at least four Member States have to vote against a proposal. A new scheme inspired by the ‘Ioannina compromise’ allows 55% (75% until 1 April 2017) of the Member States necessary for the blocking minority to ask for reconsideration of a proposal during a ‘reasonable time period’ (Declaration 7).
    
    The Council meets in public when it deliberates and votes on a draft legislative act. To this end, each Council meeting is divided into two parts, dealing respectively with legislative acts and non-legislative activities. The Council presidency continues to rotate on a six-month basis, but there are 18-month group presidencies of three Member States in order to ensure better continuity of work. As an exception, the Foreign Affairs Council is continuously chaired by the VP / HR.


=== SEGMENT 57 ===
[Summary: The political legitimacy of the Commission President is increased as their selection now considers the outcome of European elections, and they manage the internal organization of the college. The jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is extended to all Union activities, excluding CFSP, while access for individuals is facilitated. Additionally, "passerelle clauses" are introduced to enable a shift from unanimous decision-making to qualified majority voting and from consultation to codecision procedures, aiming for more efficient policymaking.]

5.  **The Commission**
    Since the President of the Commission is now chosen and elected taking into account the outcome of the European elections, the political legitimacy of the office is increased. The President is responsible for the internal organisation of the college (appointment of commissioners, distribution of portfolios, requests to resign under particular circumstances).

6.  **The Court of Justice of the European Union**
    The jurisdiction of the Court is extended to all activities of the Union with the exception of the CFSP. Access to the Court is facilitated for individuals.

**D. More efficient and democratic policymaking with new policies and new competencies**

Several passerelle clauses allow for a change from unanimous decision-making to qualified majority voting and from the consultation procedure to codecision (Article 31(3) TEU, Articles 81, 153, 192, 312 and 333 TFEU, as well as some passerelle-type procedures concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters) (1.2.4).


=== SEGMENT 58 ===
[Summary: Commission President Juncker initiated efforts in 2017 to move away from the unanimity rule by utilizing passerelle clauses, leading to communications proposing Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) in fields such as CFSP, tax, energy/climate, and social policy to enhance decision-making efficiency. The text also describes enhanced cooperation, which requires authorization by the Council (with Parliament's consent) and a minimum of nine Member States in non-exclusive areas, noting that CFSP matters still require unanimity.]

In his 2017 State of the Union speech, Commission President Juncker announced initiatives to move away from the unanimity rule in a number of areas by using the passerelle clauses. As a follow-up, the Commission has adopted four communications, proposing to enhance the use of qualified majority voting instead of unanimity in the fields of the CFSP (September 2018), tax policy (January 2019), energy and climate policy (April 2019) and social policy (April 2019). These communications aim to render decision-making more prompt, flexible and efficient where an EU competence already exists.

In areas where the Union has no exclusive powers, at least nine Member States can establish enhanced cooperation among themselves. The Council must authorise its usage after obtaining Parliament’s consent. On CFSP matters, unanimity applies.


=== SEGMENT 59 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon significantly strengthened the principle of subsidiarity by formally involving national parliaments in the EU decision-making process. It also introduced or extended several policies, notably in environment (now including the fight against climate change) and energy (focusing on supply security and interconnectivity). Furthermore, new areas such as intellectual property rights, sport, space, tourism, civil protection, and administrative cooperation became potential subjects for EU lawmaking.]

The Treaty of Lisbon considerably strengthens the principle of subsidiarity by involving the national parliaments in the EU decision-making process (1.2.2) (1.3.5). A certain number of new or extended policies have been introduced in both environment policy, which now includes the fight against climate change, and energy policy, which makes new references to solidarity and the security and interconnectivity of supply. Furthermore, intellectual property rights, sport, space, tourism, civil protection and administrative cooperation are now possible subjects of EU lawmaking.


=== SEGMENT 60 ===
[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon introduced significant provisions for the common security and defence policy (CSDP), including a mutual defence clause obliging Member States to assist one another if attacked, and a solidarity clause for aid during catastrophes or terrorist attacks. It also established 'permanent structured cooperation' (PESCO) for Member States committed to military cooperation, requiring a qualified majority in the Council for its establishment. Furthermore, the European Parliament, for the first time, sent three representatives to the 2007 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) that led to the Treaty's signature.]

On the common security and defence policy (5.1.2), the Treaty of Lisbon introduces a mutual defence clause, which provides that all Member States are obliged to provide help to a Member State under attack. A solidarity clause provides that the Union and each of its Member States have to provide assistance by all possible means to a Member State affected by a human or natural catastrophe or by a terrorist attack. A ‘permanent structured cooperation’ is open to all Member States that commit themselves both to taking part in European military equipment programmes and to providing combat units that are available for immediate action. To establish such cooperation, it is necessary to obtain a qualified majority in the Council after consultation with the VP / HR.

**ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT**

See 1.1.4 for Parliament’s contributions to the European Convention and its involvement in previous IGCs. With respect to the 2007 IGC, leading to the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament, for the first time, sent three representatives to the conference under the Portuguese Presidency.


=== SEGMENT 61 ===
[Summary: Almost a decade after the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament acknowledged that many of its provisions were not being fully utilized. Consequently, on February 16, 2017, Parliament adopted two resolutions: one focused on maximizing the potential of the existing Lisbon Treaty to tackle global challenges, and the other suggested concrete proposals for reforming the EU's institutional set-up and Treaties.]

Almost a decade after the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament acknowledged that some of its provisions were not being used to the fullest. Therefore, on 16 February 2017 it adopted a resolution on improving the functioning of the European Union by building on the potential of the Lisbon Treaty, which puts forward a number of recommendations on how to unblock this potential in order to enhance the Union’s capacity to tackle current global challenges.

On the same day, Parliament also adopted a resolution on the possible evolution of and adjustments to the current institutional set-up of the European Union, suggesting concrete proposals for Treaty reforms.


=== SEGMENT 62 ===
[Summary: Recent major crises, including Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, exposed significant shortcomings in the EU's governance and decision-making efficiency, leading to decreased public support. In response, the EU institutions launched the Conference on the Future of Europe on March 10, 2021, which concluded in May 2022 with 49 proposals, some requiring Treaty changes. Consequently, the European Parliament has adopted several resolutions urging the European Council to call a convention to revise the Treaties, aiming to modernize legislative procedures and enhance EU effectiveness.]

The EU has lately faced several crises, particularly in relation to Brexit, the rule of law, the multiannual financial framework, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The handling of these crises has again exposed shortcomings in the current system of governance, and the lack of efficient decision-making has contributed to a decrease in public support for the European project. In response to current challenges, on 10 March 2021, the EU institutions launched the Conference on the Future of Europe, designed to give citizens a say on how to reshape the EU and increase the effectiveness and transparency of its decision-making procedures. On 9 May 2022, the Conference concluded its work, which resulted in 49 proposals, some of which require changes to the EU Treaties. Consequently, Parliament adopted a resolution on the call for a convention for the revision of the Treaties on 9 June 2022; a resolution on the implementation of the passerelle clauses in the EU Treaties on 11 July 2023 and a resolution on proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on 22 November 2023. By urging the European Council to call for a convention to revise the Treaties, Parliament is attempting to modernise legislative procedures to address current challenges and enhance EU effectiveness.
