[Summary: The European Union is facing unprecedented challenges in its new institutional cycle, prompting a report titled "The State of the European Union 2024: Integration vs. Nationalism." The report analyzes critical issues such as competitiveness against the USA and China, decarbonization, defense, migration, the social pillar, and the rule of law. These structural reforms are being addressed within a complex geopolitical context where more conservative positions have gained influence in the European Parliament and the European Commission.]

In the new institutional cycle, the European Union is facing unprecedented challenges. This report studies and analyses some of the most outstanding aspects such as competitiveness and reindustrialisation in the light of competition from the USA and China; the transition to a decarbonised Europe; the need to defensively strengthen the Union and its foreign action; the migratory issue; the European social pillar or the rule of law.All this comes within a complex geopolitical context that helps to approach structural reforms to renewed institutions such as the European Parliament and the European Commission, where more conservative positions have thrived.

[Summary: The Fundación Alternativas Report on the State of the European Union analyzes the start of the new institutional cycle (2024-2028), focusing on how the newly elected European Parliament and Commission will devise policies alongside the European Council and Council of Ministers. A key finding from the recent European elections is the significant growth in representation for the right-wing and populist far-right. This rise is crucial because their ideology, characterized by euro-scepticism, nationalism, and protectionism, is expected to condition the Union's actions over the next five years.]

## INTRODUCTION
### Integration vs. Nationalism
*by Diego López Garrido*

Another year on, Fundación Alternativas is drafting its Report on the State of the European Union, which aims to study how the Union is developing politically, looking firmly to the future. On this occasion, the Report’s focus is structured around the start of a European institutional cycle (2024-2028), following the election of a new European Parliament and a new European Commission.

These two institutions are going to devise the Union’s policies to a large extent, participating decisively in community legislation (Regulations and Directives), always in conjunction with consensual guidance agreed within the European Council and the Council of Ministers, comprising heads of government and ministers from the 27 member states of the European Union.

Thus, recent European elections —which have a more national than European dynamic in practice— revealed a variation that is going to condition how the Union acts over the next five years. This refers to growth in representation for the right-wing and the populist far-right. Their ideology is characterised by euro-scepticism, nationalism and protectionism. This is cast into a clearly xenophobic discourse, in parallel with what is trumpeted by the Republican Party in the United States, under Donald Trump.


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: The far-right's racist discourse is deemed economically detrimental to Europe, which relies on large-scale immigration to maintain its Welfare State. The rise of the far-right is correlated with a shift in the European Parliament's gender balance, resulting in fewer women and more men for the first time since 1979. However, the Parliament retains a pro-Europe majority—including the centre-right, socialists, liberals, and greens—which supports multilateralism and the Pact on Migration and Asylum.]

The racism which comes through in their discourse is objectively contrary to the general interests of European citizens, both from a moral stance and regarding an economy which needs large-scale immigration to maintain the West’s home-grown Welfare State. Migratory movements vary according to the needs of the job market and are consequently structural in our socio-economic model.

Analysis of the election results across Europe demonstrates that the rise of the far-right is masculine by nature. For the first time since 1979, there are fewer women and more men in the European Parliament, with a clear correlation between this increase and the rise of more right-wing parties. However, in the light of more conservative political forces, the European Parliament has maintained a pro-Europe majority, comprising centre-right parties (the Popular Party won the elections), socialists, liberals and greens.

Despite their natural differences, these parties defend an economically-open and politically-multilateral concept. They also support the Pact on Migration and Asylum approved during the Spanish Presidency of the Council (second semester of 2023).


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: The composition of the European Commission under Ursula Von der Layen saw a quantitative decrease in female representation, though this was partially compensated for by appointing four female vice-presidents, including Spain's Teresa Ribera. The EU is currently facing a major 'latent' political dilemma, characterized by a struggle between forces favoring European integration and those pushing for nationalist fragmentation, which defines the scenario for the new institutional cycle. The Commission also requested economic policy reports from Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi.]

Looking at the composition of the European Commission presided over by Ursula Von der Layen, for the first time, the number of women has dropped, and the number of men has increased, marking a quantitative step back. An attempt has been made to qualitatively compensate for this by appointing four female vice-presidents. The first of them is bound to be Spain’s Teresa Ribera, who will hold the powerful portfolio for Competition and for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition.

The European Union is thereby facing a real ‘latent’ political dilemma, speaking in Merton’s terms, although this is not ‘manifestly’ expressed. This is a struggle between an integrating Europe and a nationalist version which is attempting to break up the European space. This is the political scenario awaiting the Union’s new institutional cycle.

Approaching this outlook in terms of economic policy, the Commission asked Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi to write reports which have proved to be most enlightening.


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: Reports by Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi warn that the European market is suffering from fragmentation and poor productivity, which is significantly lower than the USA. Draghi proposes an annual investment of €800 billion (4.7% of GDP) and advocates for a unified industrial strategy and relaxed competition rules to compete globally. Addressing these shortfalls is complicated by the EU's small common budget (under 1% of GDP) and the absence of a capital market or integrated Banking Union, despite European productivity having dropped 30% relative to the USA since the 1990s.]

Both raise the alarm on fragmentation of the European market, which is less ‘single’ than it should be, and which suffers from poor productivity —much lower than the USA— which will require investment.

Draghi proposes €800bn [4.7% GDP] of investment every year in Europe to avoid an agonizing downturn. In terms of productivity, 80 % depends on investment. Draghi talks about an industrial strategy in Europe to compete with China and the USA and believes that competition rules should be relaxed. He demands a unified European response and criticises a lack of coordination in energy, industrial and commercial and fiscal innovation policies.

It is difficult to counter these shortfalls with a common budget that does not exceed 1 % of the European GDP and the absence of a capital market or a Banking Union. Europe must integrate its banking system —predominantly national right now— if it wishes to invest at the level required by the productivity shortfall. Productivity has dropped by around 30 % in Europe compared to the USA since the 1990s, which ECB sources attribute to the continent’s incapacity to draw on the benefits of developing digital technology.


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: Following the 2020 pandemic, the US saw a surge in productivity by relocating workers, contrasting with Europe's strategy of protecting jobs through furlough schemes. This difference is reflected in the US annual productivity growth rate of 1.6% versus the EU's 0.5%. The text suggests that EU market fragmentation is the fundamental reason for this gap, a fragmentation that also underlies the current trade war with China regarding electric car tariffs.]

The USA’s productivity soared after the 2020 pandemic, by relocating workers into other jobs, as opposed to Europe which decided to protect jobs using the furlough scheme (the Welfare State is greater in Europe).

Productivity (average production of one worker in one hour of work) has now increased at an annual rate of 1.6 % in the USA compared to 0.5 % in the European Union.

The fundamental reason behind this difference is most likely market fragmentation within the EU. Economic fragmentation also explains the trade war which has broken out between Europe and China, relating to increasing tariffs on Chinese electric cars.

Protectionism and the division of the global economy will damage growth for everyone and will make it difficult for us to gain control over the rifts intended to affect the next few decades: Artificial Intelligence, the disruptive geopolitics of the 21st century, that will impose interdependencies, and climate change, that is forcing us to no longer base our economy on consumption but on recycling, reuse and longevity (Financial Times).


=== SEGMENT 9 ===
[Summary: The European Union faces significant economic challenges due to its aging demographics, marked by a shrinking working-age population (270 million in 2011 to 261 million recently) and a low fertility rate (1.46 in 2022), which has contributed to a drop in GDP per capita. This demographic shift increases pressure on national public health spending and highlights the need for immigration, though the issue remains politically contentious.]

The Union’s aging demographics will condition its future. The working-age population, between 20 and 64 years old, who contribute the most to tax-related income, fell from 270 million people in 2011 to 261 million this year, according to UN estimations. Regarding the total population, the working-age group stood at 61.4 % in 2008 and has currently dropped to 58 %. Consequently, GDP per capita has also dropped. The EU fertility rate dropped to 1.46 in 2022 (1.16 in Spain) which is below the replacement level (2.1).

All these points argue the need for immigration that, nevertheless, is being used politically by the far-right. On the other hand, as a positive aspect, it should be highlighted that Europe boasts a higher life expectancy than any other continent. In 2022, only 6 % of people aged over 65 were working (one quarter in Japan). These figures pile pressure on public health spending, which is national.


=== SEGMENT 10 ===
[Summary: European fragmentation severely impacts security and defense, resulting in a lack of strategic autonomy despite the launch of the European Defence Industry Strategy in March 2024. The EU maintains 27 complex national military industries, which increases costs and inefficiency, forcing the bloc to purchase 78% of its military equipment outside the EU, mostly from the USA.]

European fragmentation also affects security, even though the Commission launched the European Defence Industry Strategy in March 2024. Right now, there is no ‘strategic autonomy’, or integration of the defence policy and industry. Over the last two years, 78 % of military equipment was purchased outside the European Union, mostly in the USA.

Europe thereby has 27 complex military industries, now without the United Kingdom, which increases costs and lowers efficiency. This happens with each member of NATO. In all these fields, nationalism makes reforms much more difficult, which leads us ever-further away from the United States and China, from worldwide value and supply chains.

A further demonstration of t

[Summary: Weak European foreign policy hinders integration, primarily because it was designed for a peaceful, multilateral world but now faces global turbulence, acute anti-Western attitudes from Russia and China, and mistrust from the Global South. In response to anti-integration concepts, six European think tanks collaborated last July to draft an open letter titled "Europe’s Choice," which focuses on promoting pro-European unity.]

he difficulties for integration to prevail over nationalism lies in weak European foreign policy. According to Letta, the problem is that the policy was forged for a multilateral world at peace, based on rules and norms. Today, however, the world is turbulent, with a very acute anti-Western attitude in Russia and China and international institutions in a difficult situation. Furthermore, the ‘Global South’ mistrusts Western powers.To finish off this introduction, I would like to mention that six European think tanks got together last July to draft an “open letter to the European Institutions”. These were: Centre for European Reform (London, Brussels and Berlin); Fondazione Astrid (Roma); Fondazione ResPublica (Milán); Las Gracques (Paris); Terra Nova (Paris) and Fundación Alternativas.The letter is headed “Europe’s Choice” and claims to provide a response from pro-European forces to anti-integration concepts, focussed on what unites us.


=== SEGMENT 12 ===
[Summary: An ambitious agenda for the European Union outlines six components, the first three of which focus on security, budget reform, and transition mitigation. The security policy must operate within the Atlantic Alliance but maintain sufficient EU autonomy, particularly against potential US isolationism post-November 2024 elections. Furthermore, the EU Budget requires fundamental reform, including expansion up to 2% of European GDP and financing green and digital transitions via new Own Resources, alongside measures to ensure these transitions are economically and socially viable through active citizen participation.]

An ambitious agenda for the European Union must include six components:1. A security and defence policy within the Atlantic Alliance, although with sufficient autonomy and visibility in the face of isolationist tendencies that might emerge in the United States after the elections in November 2024.2. Fundamental reform of the EU Budget based on fiscal capacity that provides public goods in green and digital transitions, financed by new Own Resources. Given the investment needs, it is appropriate to expand the Budget up to 2 % of European GDP.3. Adopting measures at national and European level to mitigate the impact of green and digital transitions so that they are economically, financially and socially viable. In this respect, active participation from citizens is essential, as the Commission mentioned in its Communication to the Parliament of December 2019.


=== SEGMENT 13 ===
[Summary: The ambitious agenda for the European Union outlines three crucial economic components: ensuring sustainable national public finances through the credible enforcement of new fiscal rules, integrating and regulating European financial markets via the Banking Union and Capital Market Union, and implementing an industrial policy focused on competitiveness and innovation. This industrial policy must strengthen the single market, safeguard the Union's role in international value chains, and specifically include migrants while avoiding protectionism.]

4. Credible enforcement of the new fiscal rules to ensure sustainable national public finances and support long-term economic growth and competition, thereby ensuring the necessary investments.5. A move towards integrated, well-regulated European financial markets. A Banking Union and a Capital Market Union that help to mobilise financial wealth, to stimulate private investments that boost productivity, competition and sustainable growth in the European Union.6. An industrial policy that supports competitiveness and innovation, avoiding protectionist temptations. The single market must be strengthened, creating new instruments to safeguard the role of the Union in international value chains, with the aim of combining innovative production, effective services, high-quality education systems and specialised, well-trained workers. A special effort should be made in including migrants.


=== SEGMENT 14 ===
[Summary: Implementing the proposed agenda is crucial for preserving the European social model and ensuring a sustainable future. This requires fundamental reform of the EU's decision-making rules, specifically moving to majority voting in the Council and joint decisions with the European Parliament, which must happen before the next enlargement, overcoming the taboo of treaty changes. Furthermore, the EU must act as a global actor, reviving multilateralism and ensuring European integration prevails over nationalism.]

The implementation of this agenda is crucial to preserve and strengthen the European social model, thus offering a sustainable future to new generations. This can only be achieved by reforming Europe’s decision-making rules, by moving to majority voting in the Council of the European Union and a joint decision by the European Parliament. This reform must happen before, not after, the next enlargement, overcoming the taboo of treaty changes.The European Union must be a global actor in the world order, reviving multilateralism and avoiding the pure logic of power in international relations.To sum up, this requires European integration to prevail over nationalism.


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament (EP) has evolved significantly since its first direct elections in 1979, with the 2024 vote marking the 45th anniversary of this procedure. Following numerous changes, including the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty and the expansion to 27 Member States, the EP has transformed from a purely deliberative body into a central legislative institution. It now holds extensive powers, including virtually full budgetary authority and the responsibility for electing the President of the European Commission, granting it extraordinary political relevance in EU decision-making.]

---# 1## The New European Parliament### Composition and balance of power*by CARLOS CARNERO*## 1. THE NEW EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT### 1. FORTY-FIVE YEARS OF DIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTThe first elections to the European Parliament (EP) by direct ballot took place in 1979, meaning the vote held in 2024 marked the 45th anniversary of the start of this procedure, an extraordinarily important step in the process of the EU gaining greater political depth.Since then, the European Union has seen numerous variations in the number of Member States and changes in its basic law before arriving at the 27 current partners and the Lisbon Treaty (95% of which comes from the Constitution drafted by the Convention).With those changes, the EP has steadily evolved in terms of number of seats and duties to become a legislative body with powers resting on dozens of legal bases, virtually full budgetary authority and a chamber that elects the president of the European Commission and the college of commissioners they lead, among other responsibilities.The EP’s institutional centrality, then, has afforded it extraordinary political relevance in community debate and decision, resulting in an exponential increase in its public and media exposure, a far cry from its inception as a purely deliberative delegate assembly.


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: Despite the European Parliament's growing importance and its involvement in major crises (such as the pandemic and Ukraine) and beneficial policies (like reducing mobile phone roaming costs), citizen engagement in EP elections remains persistently low. Historical turnout data illustrates this trend, starting at 61.99% in 1979 and reaching 51.05% in the 2024 election.]

### 2. PERSISTENT ABSTENTION: FIGURES, REASONS AND REMEDIESDespite the importance the European Parliament has gained in the eyes of public opinion, citizen engagement with the European elections has yet to take off, to the point that it appears endemic and practically irremediable.Neither its role in the face of successive crises that have rocked the EU (pandemic, Ukraine, economic) nor the numerous decisions taken on matters that directly improve citizens’ quality of life (the cost of roaming to mobile phone customers is a prime example) have succeeded in lowering abstention, even if only by a few percentage points. On the contrary, voter turnout remains on a downward trend, albeit by a few tenths of a percent.One only need look at the election turnout history:- 1979: 61,99 %- 1984: 58,98 %- 1989: 58,41 %- 1994: 56,67 %- 1999: 59,51 %- 2004: 45,47 %- 2009: 42,97 %- 2014: 42,61 %- 2019: 50,66 %- 2024: 51,05 %


=== SEGMENT 17 ===
[Summary: Voter turnout in the 2024 European Parliament elections varied significantly across Member States, with participation rates ranging widely, from 89.01% in Belgium to 21.35% in Croatia. The text notes that "election fatigue" seemed particularly acute in nations incorporated during the last enlargement. These figures, while not detracting from the Parliament's legitimacy, compel pro-European parties to analyze the causes of high abstention and seek ways to substantially reduce it.]

When reading these figures, it is worth remembering that there were differences in turnout by country in the 2024 vote, when it appears election fatigue was particularly (though not exclusively) acute in nations incorporated in the last enlargement:- Belgium: 89,01 %*- Denmark: 58,25 %- Germany: 64,74 %- Ireland: 50,65 %- France: 51,49 %- Italy: 48,31 %- Luxembourg: 82,24 %- The Netherlands: 46,18 %- Greece: 41,39 %- Spain: 49,21 %- Portugal: 36,63 %- Sweden: 53,39 %- Austria: 56,25 %- Finland: 40,40 %- Czechia: 36,45 %- Estonia: 37,60 %- Cyprus: 58,86 %- Lithuania: 28,35 %- Latvia: 33,82 %- Hungary: 59,46 %- Malta: 73 %- Poland: 40,65 %- Slovenia: 41,80 %- Slovakia: 34,38 %- Bulgaria: 33,78 %- Romania: 52,42 %- Croatia: 21,35 %*(Member States in alphabetical order according to name in original language)Naturally, none of this detracts from the chamber’s legitimacy or representativeness, but it does invite the pro-European parties to consider why abstention is so high and what can be done to substantially reduce it.Here, it would be useful to look at several factors.First, those related to domestic politics, including:


=== SEGMENT 18 ===
[Summary: The high rate of abstention in European elections is attributed to several domestic political factors that diminish the perceived importance of the vote. These factors include governments and media framing the elections as secondary, governments appropriating positive decisions while blaming the EU for negative ones, and the resulting public ignorance regarding the co-decision reality between the Council and the European Parliament. Additionally, the "nationalization" of campaigns, which focuses on domestic policy debates and features non-candidate party leaders, further sidelines European affairs and makes the vote appear dispensable.]

- The popularisation of the idea by governments, political parties and media that the European elections are secondary in comparison with national, regional and local ballots.- The appropriation by governments of “positive” decisions, while blaming the EU for the “unpleasant” ones.- Hence the persistence of the widespread idea that it is the national governments that “really” make the decisions in Brussels, keeping citizens in the dark about the reality of co-decision between the Council and the EP. This makes national elections the truly decisive votes and the European elections, at best, a complementary ballot and, at worst, purely decorative.- The presentation of candidates who voters perceive as “second-tier” or seeking a “gilded retirement”, even though this is unfair in both cases.- The “nationalisation” of the European election campaign, featuring the party leaders even if they are not candidates to sit in Strasbourg, making the vote appear more dispensable than it actually is.- In connection with that nationalisation, the transformation of European election campaigns into a public forum of debate between the government and opposition in which European affairs are sidelined in favour of domestic policy issues.- The absence of a systematic education of citizens in the community decision-making process, from school to university, from the media to political discourse. This impedes understanding of the importance of the EP and the elections that determine its composition.


=== SEGMENT 19 ===
[Summary: While a common issue, such as the rise of the far right in the 2024 elections, was identified as a potential "federating dilemma" to boost turnout, it ultimately failed to increase participation. The text argues that improving turnout requires legislative reforms, particularly the introduction of transnational lists, which would feature candidates for European Commission President but were prevented from being used in the 2024 elections.]

It is true, however, that the existence of an issue that acts as a common denominator would make it easier to spotlight that voting in European elections is not only important in the country a ballot is cast, but rather forms part of an aggregate decision across the whole of the EU, which would be an incentive to go out and vote.That happened in the elections of 2024, with the signalling of what I venture to call a “federating dilemma”: the march of the far right, which featured as a “danger” in the campaigns of all the pro-EU parties and as an “incentive” in the campaigns of the parties that are part of that trend.Yet it failed to trigger an increase in turnout, perhaps because it was the first time it had appeared; because it was not seen that way in several countries where the far right is already in government; or because it was conveyed in an irremediably heterogeneous manner in the 27 Member States as there are no Europe-wide media outlets.Along with all those factors (where it would be enough to act differently) there are others we might call “positive”, which focus on improving and standardising European electoral legislation. These include various measures proposed by the European Parliament that unfortunately have been left to gather dust.One of them, which is fundamental, is the presentation of transnational lists, from which a specific number of MEPs would be elected, and which would be topped by the candidates to become president of the European Commission.That would have been possible in the 2024 elections had the attitude of certain governments not prevented it.There are a


=== SEGMENT 20 ===
[Summary: The text outlines the numerous advantages of implementing transnational lists in European elections, arguing they would denationalize campaigns, strengthen European political parties, and increase the credibility of the candidates for European Commission President (Spitzenkandidaten). However, it notes that for this system to be effective, Spitzenkandidaten must adhere to the Treaty article requiring them to stand as MEPs, a requirement ignored by major candidates like von der Leyen and Schmidt in the 2024 elections.]

 number of advantages to transnational lists: - They serve as an instrument to denationalise the European election campaign. - They showcase the value of European citizenship with the casting of a multinational ballot. - They bolster the role of the European political parties, which do laudable work but are always gaslighted by the national parties. - They raise awareness of the European political parties’ manifestos, which are what really count once the EP is formed and which in 2024 have presented some genuine policy direction and concrete proposals. - They lend credibility to the candidates to head the European Commission (the Spitzenkandidaten) and to the article in the Treaty that establishes that the Council shall propose one of them to preside it, taking into account the result of the European elections. However, it should be noted that the candidates to lead the Commission must be the first to abide by that article and stand to be elected MEPs. Neither von der Leyen for the EPP nor Schmidt for the Socialists or The Left candidate appeared on any electoral list. One might imagine they would have done so had they been able to head their respective transnational list.


=== SEGMENT 21 ===
[Summary: The 2024 European election results, while confirming gains for the far right, were less severe than the gloomiest predictions and did not overturn the established pro-European consensus among conservatives, socialists, and liberals. The far-right advance was insufficient to determine decision-making in the European Parliament. Furthermore, analyzing abstention is significant because it is believed to highlight its effect in favour of anti-European and Eurosceptic parties.]

As well as confirming its persistence, examining abstention serves another significant purpose: to highlight its effect in favour of anti-European and Eurosceptic parties, in the assumption that they would wield less clout had the turnout been higher. ### 3. THE RESULTS OVERALL: PRO-EUROPEAN PARTIES WIN THE DAY, BUT THE FAR RIGHT MAKES GAINS On the subject of those figures, the 2024 election results, while concerning, were a far cry from the gloomiest predictions, which forecast a huge advance for the far right and a shift in majorities with likely consequences for European construction. That advance did happen, certainly, but not to the extent of determining decision-making in the European Parliament and nullifying a repetition of the pro-European consensus among conservatives, socialists and liberals that has dominated the European institutions since their inception. A contributing factor was the “federating dilemma” (far right: yes or no) around which the election campaign revolved, doggedly and vociferously sustained from the outset by Socialists, liberals, the Greens and The Left, and ultimately (though with certain caveats) by the EPP candidate.


=== SEGMENT 22 ===
[Summary: The election results are categorized into Pro-European and Far Right camps. The Pro-European camp secured a dominant 500 seats, led by the European People’s Party (188 seats), Socialists & Democrats (136 seats), and Renew (77 seats). The Far Right camp obtained 187 seats, with Patriots for Europe (84 seats) and European Conservatives and Reformists (78 seats) being the largest groups.]

The ballot boxes delivered the following results, if we divide them into pro-European and far-right camps: **Pro-European (500 seats)** - European People’s Party: 188 seats (presidency: Manfred Weber, Germany) - Socialists & Democrats: 136 seats (Iratxe García, Spain) - Renew (liberals): 77 seats (Valèrie Haye, France) - Greens: 53 seats (Bas Eickhout, the Netherlands, and Terry Reinke, Germany) - The Left: 46 seats (Manon Aubry, France, and Martin Schirdewan, Germany) **Far right (187 seats)** - Patriots for Europe: 84 seats (Jordan Bardella, France) - European Conservatives and Reformists: 78 seats (Joaquim Stanilaw, Poland, and Nicola Procaccini, Italy) - Europe of Sovereign Nations: 25 (René Aust, Germany) There is a third group of seats known as non-inscrits, which includes several MEPs who are openly far-right.


=== SEGMENT 23 ===
[Summary: The analysis provides the percentage breakdown of seats won by various political groups in the European Parliament elections. Excluding non-inscrits, the Pro-European groups collectively secured 69.44% of the seats, while the Far Right groups obtained 25.97%. Among the individual groups, the European People's Party (PPE) held the largest share at 26.11%.]

If we go by percentages of seats, the breakdown would be as follows: **Pro-European** - PPE; 26,11 % - Socialists & Democrats: 18,89 % - Renew (liberals): : 10,69 % - Greens: 7,36 % - The left: 6,39 % **Far right** - Patriots for Europe: 11,67 % - European Conservatives and Reformists: 10,83 % - Europe of Sovereign Nations: 3,47 % Which means that – excluding the non-inscrits from either camp – the pro-Europeans obtained 69.44% of the seats and the far right, 25.97%.


=== SEGMENT 24 ===
[Summary: Dividing European Parliament results strictly into 'right' and 'left' is considered misleading due to significant ideological and policy differences within these broad camps. For example, the EPP is pro-European and Atlanticist, contrasting with the far right, and disagreements exist even on the left regarding key issues like new European fiscal rules. Furthermore, the major pro-European groups prioritize striking broad, long-term agreements that often transcend typical ideological boundaries.]

Could we divide the results between right and left? Of course, but it would be misleading, for several reasons: - We would have to group in the same camp parties that, unlike in the traditional setup at home, do not have a common ideological identity in the European sphere. The EPP, for example, is pro-European while the far right is not. - The same applies in terms of policy specifics that currently form a fault line: the EPP is Atlanticist and backs Ukraine while on the far right it is frequently quite the opposite. - The situation also arises on the left on key issues: the Socialists have supported new European fiscal rules while The Left has been totally opposed. - The big pro-European groups strike broad agreements to last the entire legislative period (as is the case regarding the choice of Commission president and her programme), even if they do occasionally agree on the odd legislative decision in impromptu deals with groups on their right or on their left that are neither ideological nor form part of their manifestos.

[Summary: The far right in the European Parliament is fragmented into three groups—Patriots for Europe, European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), and Europe of Sovereign Nations—despite general ideological alignment, except on issues like NATO and Ukraine. This division has led some EPP members, like Manfred Weber, to consider selective cooperation with the ECR, though the ECR initially voted against von der Leyen's election. Furthermore, the far right holds significant influence in the Council of the EU due to its participation in the governments of several member states.]

### 4. FRAGMENTATION OF THE FAR RIGHT Grouping the far right into a single bloc may make sense if we are talking about general political orientation, with the exception of their stance on NATO, Ukraine and Putin’s Russia. Yet the interests of each of the parties that make up the far right have resulted in its split into three groups in the European Parliament: Patriots for Europe, European Conservatives and Reformists and Europe of Sovereign Nations. The first of these, comprising 13 parties, is led by two groups: Marine Le Pen’s RN from France and Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz from Hungary. The second is led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy and Poland’s PiS, and the third, by Alternative for Germany. This division could act as a lure to those in the EPP (like its president, Manfred Weber) who favour selective rapprochement with some on their right, namely the Conservatives and Reformists, as they consider them akin given their positions on international affairs. Those hopes were thwarted in the first instance as Meloni’s Conservatives and Reformists voted with the rest of the far right against von der Leyen’s election. In any event, we must keep in mind that the far right already sits in the Council of the EU (given its presence in the governments of Italy, Finland, Slovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands and Croatia, with external support for the government Sweden) and that will feed directly into the positions of its parliamentary groups in Strasbourg.


=== SEGMENT 26 ===
[Summary: The June 2024 European Parliament elections established the European People’s Party (EPP) as the clear winner, while center-left and liberal/Green groups saw declining support. The traditional center-right/center-left coalition (EPP and Socialists) requires the Liberals to comfortably reach an absolute majority (361 seats). Although the far right achieved its best result ever, it lacks the numbers to block majorities, but the EPP retains the option of forming ad hoc majorities with the far right on specific issues.]

### 5. BALANCE OF POWER: A PRO-EUROPEAN AND CENTRED CHAMBER Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of the June 2024 vote: - The clear winner of the elections was the European People’s Party, with the Socialists remaining on a downward trend and a drop in support for the liberals, Greens, and The Left. - The relative majority (321) of the EPP and Socialists combined is well short of an absolute majority (361). - An absolute majority can only comfortably be achieved by including the liberals (401). - The absolute majority is greater still if we add the Greens (454) and The Left (500); groups however that will often differ with the centre right and centre left. - The far right had never achieved such a good result, but it fell well short of some of the pre-election poll predictions. - The far right lacks the numbers to win or block neither absolute majority votes nor simple majority votes of those present in the European Parliament. - Discounting any global or standing agreement, it will, however, depend on the European People’s Party to strike ad hoc agreements with the far right on certain issues, because between them they could form a majority.


=== SEGMENT 27 ===
[Summary: Von der Leyen’s election demonstrated the formation of a stable, pro-EU majority on key issues, typically comprising the EPP, Socialists, liberals, and Greens, which is sufficient to halt Eurosceptic advances. The balance of power in the European Parliament elected in 2024 is clearly pro-EU and occupies the political centre ground, dominated by the EPP and the Socialists. This stable, pro-EU alignment is also reflected across the European Council, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission, ensuring solid ground for the EU's political government and legislative action.]

In any case, as we shall see later, von der Leyen’s election as head of the European Commission demonstrated the desire to form a pro-EU majority on key issues, comprising the EPP, Socialists, liberals and Greens. It may vary according to the political and legislative decision under debate, but it will always be sufficient to halt the advance of Eurosceptic and anti-European positions. In other words, the balance of power in the European Parliament elected in 2024 is clearly pro-EU and occupies the political centre ground between conservatives and progressives, with two hegemonic parties: the EPP and the Socialists. The same applies to the European Council, the Council of the EU and the European Commission, which means the EU’s political government and legislative action is on solid ground in every one of its institutions.


=== SEGMENT 28 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament began its tenth term on July 17, with the first votes for the Parliament's President and Bureau demonstrating the effective operation of a broad pro-European majority. Roberta Metsola (EPP, Malta) was re-elected as head of the institution with overwhelming support, receiving 562 valid votes. Her support base included the EPP, Socialists, liberals, Greens, and, to some extent, the far-right Conservatives and Reformists.]

### 6. FIRST VOTES: A FUNCTIONING BROAD PRO-EUROPEAN MAJORITY The European Parliament was constituted on 17 July, beginning its tenth term. The first votes, i.e. the election of the parliament’s President and new Bureau, for one, and the President of the European Commission, for another, clearly showed the pro-European majority running like clockwork. Roberta Metsola (EPP, Malta) was re-elected as head of the institution by 562 valid votes cast by MEPs – with very broad support, then – against the only alternative candidate, Irene Montero, standing for The Left, who obtained 61 ballots. While MEPs vote in a secret paper ballot, the votes obtained by Metsola indicate that they came from the EPP, Socialists, liberals, Greens and, to a certain extent, from the far right, starting with the Conservatives and Reformists, which could be down to some of her ideological positions (her opposition to abortion) and her Mediterranean origin.


=== SEGMENT 29 ===
[Summary: The election of the 14 European Parliament vice-presidents further demonstrated the broad pro-European majority, with the largest groups securing positions quickly. The resulting Bureau included representatives from the EPP, Socialists, ECR, Renew, Greens, and The Left. Significantly, while the Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) gained entry, the more radical far-right groups, Patriots for Europe and Europe of Sovereign Nations, were excluded, an action interpreted as establishing a "cordon sanitaire."]

The election of the vice-presidents (the EP has 14, who along with the President make up the Bureau: three from the EPP, five Socialists, two ECR, two from Renew, one from the Greens and one from The Left) was also an illustration of that majority, as the those from the biggest groups were elected in the first round of voting, while those from other groups (like the one from Meloni’s party) having to go to a second ballot. An interesting situation arose here, because the Conservatives and Reformists’ entry into the Bureau contrasted with the fact that the other two far-right groups, Patriots for Europe and Europe of Sovereign Nations, were left out. This was interpreted as a cordon sanitaire around the most radical far-right groups. We shall see whether this barrier has worked later, when we look at election of the pa

[Summary: Roberta Metsola will serve as President of the European Parliament only for the first half of the term, after which she will be replaced by a Socialist. This rotation is part of a comprehensive political agreement among the EPP, Socialists, and liberals that also dictated the appointments of Ursula von der Leyen, António Costa, and Kaja Kallas to other high-ranking EU positions. The EPP's attempt to secure a full five-year mandate for Metsola was unsuccessful.]

rliamentary committee bureaus.

Metsola will only be President of the European Parliament in the first part of the term, after which she will be replaced by a Socialist, under the deal struck between these political families and the liberals when von der Leyen was designated candidate for President of the Commission; the Portuguese Socialist António Costa was appointed President of the European Council; and the Estonian liberal Kaja Kallas was named High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. And despite the EPP’s unsuccessful bid to secure her mandate for five years.


=== SEGMENT 31 ===
[Summary: The election of the German candidate to lead the Commission demonstrated the strength of a broad pro-European coalition, extending beyond the traditional EPP, Socialists, and Liberals to include the Greens. The Greens supported von der Leyen due to her program pledges and declared they were part of a substantial four-way agreement intended to last the entire legislative period, indicating that von der Leyen dropped her initial plan to woo the Conservatives and Reformists for their vote.]

But where not only the traditional but also a broad pro-European coalition really shone through was in the election of the German candidate to lead the Commission. Taking it for granted that the EPP, Socialists and liberals would vote in favour, von der Leyen was able to bring the Greens on board too, thanks to her programme pledges. On explaining its vote, the group declared they felt part of substantial four-way agreement destined to last the entire legislative period.

The support of the Greens also made it clear that the candidate proposed by the European Council was dropping her initial idea (at least in her election) of wooing the Conservatives and Reformists to secure their vote, in what should be a lasting choice. Only time will tell if this is the case.


=== SEGMENT 32 ===
[Summary: Von der Leyen secured her election with 401 votes, exceeding both the absolute majority threshold and the support she received in 2019, although some observers considered the margin narrow. Her mandate now allows her to propose a College of Commissioners, whose members must individually face rigorous hearings before EP committees. The successful confirmation of the College, voted in as a whole, is viewed as evidence that the pro-European majority von der Leyen assembled is functioning effectively.]

Von der Leyen garnered the votes of 401 members, with 284 against and 54 abstentions, well above the absolute majority threshold and the support she received when elected for the first time in 2019.

Some, however, see the margin von der Leyen won by as narrow. Yet previous Commission presidents were also elected in tight votes.

Her election gave her the mandate, in consultation with the Member States and the political families, to propose a College of Commissioners whose members appear individually before the EP committees pertaining to the duties assigned by the Commission President. If they come through these rigorous hearings, they are voted in as a whole and take office, providing further evidence that the pro-European majority assembled by von der Leyen is working.


=== SEGMENT 33 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament elected the Commission President based on a program of “political priorities” that serves as her engagement with both the EP and the European Council, guiding the Commission's legislative action. This program is structured around six main themes covering areas such as sustainable prosperity, defense, social models, and preparing the EU for the future.]

The EP elected the Commission President based on a programme of “political priorities” that represents her engagement with the European Parliament (and with the European Council, in fact) and will guide its action, starting with the legislative action, as the institution safeguarding the Community interest. It revolves around six main themes:

- A new plan for sustainable prosperity and competitiveness
- Food security, water and nature
- A new era for European defence and security
- Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model
- A global Europe
- Preparing the European Union for the future


=== SEGMENT 34 ===
[Summary: Von der Leyen structured her detailed political priorities to align with and satisfy the main demands of the four groups constituting the broad pro-European majority that supports her. For instance, she addressed the Socialists' focus on the social field, housing, and community investment, while committing to the Greens' climate and environmental agenda with "pragmatism." The successful implementation of these potentially contradictory priorities is the next challenge, though the EU has a history of resolving such conflicts.]

A thorough study of their content (which is not the purpose of this chapter of the report) reveals von der Leyen has strived to present detailed priorities that match the broad pro-European majority that backs her, satisfying the main demands of the four groups that make it up. In the case of the Socialists, for example, they are in the social field – including housing and community investment for prosperity and competitiveness – and for the Greens, continuing to pursue the climate and environmental agenda – with “pragmatism”, in her words.

The virtue will lie in fulfilling it without serious or excessive contradictions. The EU, however, has a long and successful history of resolving such contradictions.


=== SEGMENT 35 ===
[Summary: The segment introduces the question of whether a "cordon sanitaire" will be applied to the radical far right within the European Parliament (EP) committees. It explains that the EP's complex operations rely on a careful structure of parliamentary committees, which, in the tenth term, will consist of 20 standing committees, four subcommittees, and 48 standing delegations.]

### 7. A CORDON SANITAIRE AROUND THE MORE RADICAL FAR RIGHT IN THE EP COMMITTEES?

The complex functioning of the EP (the large number of members from 27 nations, the number of official languages, the complexity of the issues addressed) is possible thanks to a careful structure of parliamentary committees.

In its tenth term, the EP will have 20 standing committees and four subcommittees (the subcommittee on Public Health is new and a significant and sensible decision in view of events), plus 48 standing delegations.


=== SEGMENT 36 ===
[Summary: During the formation of the European Parliament (EP) committee Bureaus, a "cordon sanitaire" was implemented against the radical far-right groups, Patriots for Europe and Europe of Sovereign Nations. Mainstream parliamentary groups agreed to share out the presidencies and vice-presidencies that would have otherwise gone to these radical groups, while still observing the D’Hondt system distribution. Notably, the cordon sanitaire did not extend to the Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), who secured three significant committee presidencies: Agriculture, Budgets, and Petitions.]

When the committees are formed after the first plenary session of the term, each one elects its chair and vice-chairs (members and substitutes) who form the Bureau.

Did the cordon sanitaire that kept the Patriots and Sovereign Nations out of the European Parliament Bureau work in the committees?

The answer is this: as with the election of the vice-presidents of the EP, a kind of cordon sanitaire was thrown around Patriots for Europe and Europe of Sovereign Nations. It did not include the Conservatives and Reformists.

Hence the parliamentary groups came to an agreement by which they observed the distribution based on the D’Hondt system, sharing out the presidencies and vice-presidencies that would have gone to the most radical right.

As with the Bureau, in this instance ECR was given three committee presidencies: Agriculture, Budgets and Petitions, all of which come with significant political, economic and media clout


=== SEGMENT 37 ===
[Summary: The profile of the European Parliament (EP) in its tenth term indicates that 54% of its members are first-time MEPs, with the average age being 50. A key feature is the low representation of women, standing at 39%, which is a slight decrease from the ninth term (40%). This figure is considered disappointing as it distances the EP from gender parity, suggesting that mandatory parity criteria in electoral lists could help redress the situation.]

### 8. PROFILE OF THE EP IN ITS TENTH TERM

In its tenth legislative period, the EP has some significant features:

- 54% of the members are first-time MEPs
- 39% are women, compared to 40% in the ninth term
- the average age of MEPs is 50; the oldest is 77 and the youngest is 23

What surely stands out is the disappointing figure that distances the European Parliament from gender parity. It is a negative situation that community legislation for European elections establishing mandatory parity criteria when drawing up electoral lists would help to redress.


=== SEGMENT 38 ===
[Summary: The recommendations outline strategies to strengthen the European Parliament (EP) and counter the far right, primarily by maintaining the existing pro-European majority and prioritizing increased voter turnout. Key structural reforms proposed include implementing transnational lists for the 2029 EP elections and urging the EU to complete political union by granting the EP greater legislative powers, such as the legislative initiative, through constitutional reform during the current term.]

### 9. RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  It is essential to maintain the EP’s pro-European majority that came together to elect Ursula von der Leyen so as to guarantee the pursuit of greater political depth and answers to citizens’ needs, isolating the far right.
2.  It is necessary to make it a priority goal to steadily and substantially increase voter turnout in EP elections,
3.  To this end, it would be a positive move to unblock the existence of transnational lists in EP elections in 2029; for the candidates to lead the European Commission to stand to be MEPs; and for national political parties, in the government and in the opposition, to pledge to “Europeanise” EP elections through a code of conduct endorsed before the election campaign begins,
4.  The EU must complete political union, including granting greater legislative powers to the EP – starting with the legislative initiative it currently lacks, as the Commission President proposed in her investiture speech – in the framework of a constitutional reform that should take place throughout the current term.
