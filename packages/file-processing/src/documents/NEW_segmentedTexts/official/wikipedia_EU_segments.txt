[Summary: The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union composed of 27 member states, covering over 4.2 million km² and having an estimated population of more than 450 million as of 2025. Described as a sui generis entity, the EU generated a nominal GDP of approximately €17.935 trillion in 2024, accounting for about one sixth of global economic output. Its core purpose, centered on the Customs Union and internal single market, is to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital, alongside maintaining common policies on areas like trade, agriculture, and regional development.]

The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe.[8][9] The Union has a total area of 4,233,255 km2 (1,634,469 sq mi) and an estimated population of more than 450 million as of 2025. The EU is often described as a sui generis political entity combining characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.[10][11]Containing 5.5% of the world population in 2023,[12] EU member states generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around €17.935 trillion in 2024, accounting for approximately one sixth of global economic output.[13] Its cornerstone, the Customs Union, paved the way to establishing an internal single market based on standardised legal framework and legislation that applies in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market;[14] enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade,[15] agriculture,[16] fisheries, and regional development.[17]


=== SEGMENT 2 ===
[Summary: The segment details several key operational and historical facts about the EU, including the abolition of passport controls within the Schengen Area and the composition of the 20-member eurozone which uses the euro currency. The EU actively engages in global affairs through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), representing itself at bodies like the UN and G20, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012. Historically, the EU and its citizenship were established by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, with its roots tracing back to the Inner Six states and early communities like the European Coal and Steel Community.]

Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.[18] The eurozone is a group composed of the 20 EU member states that have fully implemented the EU's economic and monetary union and use the euro currency. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence. It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The EU was established, along with its citizenship, when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, and was incorporated as an international legal juridical person[clarification needed] upon entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.[19] Its beginnings can be traced to the Inner Six states (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) at the start of modern European integration in 1948, and to the Western Union, the International Authority for the Ruhr, the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, which were established by treaties.


=== SEGMENT 3 ===
[Summary: The bodies that preceded the EU, and subsequently the EU itself, grew significantly in both size and power, adding 22 new member states between 1973 and 2013 and acquiring new policy areas. The segment notes a recent change in membership dynamics: the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU in 2020, even while ten other countries are currently aspiring or negotiating to join the union.]

These increasingly amalgamated bodies grew, with their legal successor the EU, both in size through the accessions of a further 22 states from 1973 to 2013, and in power through acquisitions of policy areas. In 2020, the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU; ten countries are aspiring or negotiating to join it.HistoryMain article: History of the European UnionFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of European Union history.Further information: Treaties of the European Union and European integrationAn Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreementsvteBackground: World Wars and aftermathFurther information: Ideas of European unity before 1948


=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: Visions of European unity gained substantial momentum following World War I, leading to early concrete proposals in the 1920s. These included John Maynard Keynes's 1920 suggestion for a European customs union and the founding of the Paneuropean Union in 1923, the oldest organization dedicated to European integration. This era culminated in Aristide Briand's 1929 speech advocating for a federal Europe to ensure peace and resolve historic Franco-German conflict.]

Internationalism and visions of European unity had existed since well before the 19th century, but gained particularly as a reaction to World War I and its aftermath. In this light the first advances for the idea of European integration were made. In 1920 John Maynard Keynes proposed a European customs union for the struggling post-war European economies,[20] and in 1923 the oldest organisation for European integration, the Paneuropean Union was founded, led by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who later would found in June 1947 the European Parliamentary Union (EPU). Aristide Briand—who was Prime Minister of France, a follower of the Paneuropean Union, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for the Locarno Treaties—delivered a widely recognised speech at the League of Nations in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe and settle the historic Franco-German enmity.[21][22]


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: The escalation of WWII necessitated agreements defining common goals, beginning with the 1941 Declaration of St James's Palace and the Atlantic Charter, which helped establish the Allies and spurred the creation of new global institutions like the UN (1945) and the Bretton Woods System (1944). Post-war planning for Europe was advanced at the Moscow, Tehran (1943), and Yalta (1944) Conferences, where the decision was made to form a European Advisory Commission, later replaced by the Council of Foreign Ministers after the 1945 German surrender.]

With large-scale war being waged in Europe once again in the 1930s and becoming World War II, the question of what to fight against and what for had to be agreed on. A first agreement was the Declaration of St James's Palace of 1941, when Europe's resistance gathered in London. This was expanded on by the 1941 Atlantic Charter, establishing the Allies and their common goals, inciting a new wave of global international institutions like the United Nations (founded 1945) or the Bretton Woods System (1944).[23]In 1943 at the Moscow Conference and Tehran Conference, plans to establish joint institutions for a post-war world and Europe increasingly became a part of the agenda. This led to a decision at the Yalta Conference in 1944 to form a European Advisory Commission, later replaced by the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Allied Control Council, following the German surrender and the Potsdam Agreement in 1945.


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: Following World War II, European integration was widely accepted as the solution to prevent the extreme nationalism that caused the conflict. This movement gained significant momentum when Winston Churchill delivered a famous speech on September 19, 1946, at the University of Zürich, advocating for a "European Union" and a "Council of Europe." A month later, the Fourth French Republic established the French Union, intending to direct the decolonization of its colonies toward participation in a European community.]

By the end of the war, European integration became seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism that had caused the war.[24] On 19 September 1946, in a much recognised speech, Winston Churchill, speaking at the University of Zürich, reiterated his calls since 1930 for a "European Union" and "Council of Europe", coincidentally[25] parallel[clarification needed] to the Hertenstein Congress of the Union of European Federalists,[26] one of the then founded and later constituent members of the European Movement. One month later, the French Union was installed by the new Fourth French Republic to direct the decolonisation of its colonies so that they would become parts of a European community.[27]


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: By 1947, the post-war alliance fractured, evidenced by the rigged Polish legislative election which constituted a breach of the Yalta Agreement. March 1947 saw two major responses to the growing Soviet threat: the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk between France and the United Kingdom for mutual assistance, and the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, pledging American support for democracies.]

By 1947, a growing rift between the western Allied Powers and the Soviet Union became evident as a result of the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election, which constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement. March of that year saw two important developments. First was the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk between France and the United Kingdom. The treaty assured mutual assistance in the event of future military aggression against either nation. Though it officially named Germany as a threat, in reality the actual concern was for the Soviet Union. A few days later came the announcement of the Truman Doctrine which pledged American support for democracies to counter the Soviets.Initial years and the Paris Treaty (1948‍–‍1957)Main article: History of European integration (1948–1957)Duration: 28 seconds.0:28Subtitles available.CCAn excerpt of the Schuman Declaration, by Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 (Europe Day)Treaty of Paris (1951), establishing the ECSC

[Summary: The events following the February 1948 coup in Czechoslovakia spurred the institutionalization of modern European integration, while simultaneously marking the beginning of the Cold War due to the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council. This period saw the signing of the Treaty of Brussels, establishing the Western Union, and the founding of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) to manage the Marshall Plan. Most significantly, the pivotal Hague Congress of May 1948 led directly to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949, which served as an early forum for cooperation and achieved the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950.]

Immediately following the February 1948 coup d'état by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the London Six-Power Conference was held, resulting in the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and its incapacitation, an event marking the beginning of the Cold War. The year 1948 marked the beginning of the institutionalised modern European integration. In March 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed, establishing the Western Union (WU), followed by the International Authority for the Ruhr. Furthermore, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the predecessor of the OECD, was also founded in 1948 to manage the Marshall Plan, which led to the Soviets creating Comecon in response. The ensuing Hague Congress of May 1948 was a pivotal moment in European integration, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe,[28] and most importantly to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949 (which is now Europe Day). The Council of Europe was one of the first institutions to bring the sovereign states of (then only Western) Europe together, raising great hopes and fevered debates in the following two years for further European integration.[citation needed] It has since been a broad forum to further cooperation and shared issues, achieving for example the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950.


=== SEGMENT 9 ===
[Summary: The institutional foundation of the EU began with the Schuman Declaration on May 9, 1950, which prompted six nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, and Italy) to draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952, building upon the International Authority for the Ruhr. Supported by the Marshall Plan, the ECSC enabled European economic integration and served as the origin for key EU institutions, including the European Commission and Parliament.]

Essential for the actual birth of the institutions of the EU was the Schuman Declaration on 9 May 1950 (the day after the fifth Victory in Europe Day) and the decision by six nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, and Italy) to follow Schuman and draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty was created in 1952 the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was built on the International Authority for the Ruhr, installed by the Western Allies in 1949 to regulate the coal and steel industries of the Ruhr area in West Germany.[29] Backed by the Marshall Plan with large funds coming from the United States since 1948, the ECSC became a milestone organisation, enabling European economic development and integration and being the origin of the main institutions of the EU such as the European Commission and Parliament.[30]


=== SEGMENT 10 ===
[Summary: The initial rationale for integrating European coal and steel industries was to prevent future wars between member nations. While the 1951 Pleven Plan failed to establish a European Defence Community, the Western Union was transformed into the Western European Union (WEU) in 1954. West Germany joined NATO and the WEU in 1955, prompting the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact the same year, while the 1955 Messina Conference ordered the Spaak report, recommending the next significant steps of integration in 1956.]

Founding fathers of the European Union understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, a future war between their nations became much less likely.[31] In parallel with Schuman, the Pleven Plan of 1951 tried but failed to tie the institutions of the developing European community under the European Political Community, which was to include the also proposed European Defence Community, an alternative to West Germany joining NATO which was established in 1949 under the Truman Doctrine. In 1954 the Modified Brussels Treaty transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany eventually joined both the WEU and NATO in 1955, prompting the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact in 1955 as an institutional framework for its military domination in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Assessing the progress of European integration the Messina Conference was held in 1955, ordering the Spaak report, which in 1956 recommended the next significant steps of European integration.Treaty of Rome (1958‍–‍1972)Main article: History

[Summary: The period 1958–1972, following the 1957 Treaty of Rome, saw the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom by six founding nations, both of which became effective in 1958 and shared institutions with the existing ECSC. Despite internal tensions, particularly France's resistance to supranational power, the Merger Treaty was agreed upon in 1965 and implemented on July 1, 1967. This treaty unified the governing institutions of the three communities (ECSC, EEC, Euratom) into a single framework known collectively as the European Communities.]

Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Rome (1957), establishing the EEC
In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) and established a customs union. They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for cooperation in developing nuclear power. Both treaties came into force in 1958.[31] Although the EEC and Euratom were created separately from the ECSC, they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch (Hirsch Commission).[32][33]

The OEEC was in turn reformed in 1961 into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and its membership was extended to states outside of Europe, the United States and Canada. During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached, and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities.[34][35] Jean Rey presided over the first merged commission (Rey Commission).[36]

[Summary: The period between 1973 and 1993 marked a significant era of enlargement and deepening cooperation within the European Communities (EC). Initial expansion in 1973 included Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, followed by Greece (1981) and Portugal and Spain (1986), alongside the incorporation of East Germany upon reunification. Major steps toward integration included the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, the signing of the Schengen Agreement in 1985, and the adoption of the Single European Act in 1986.]

In 1973, the communities were enlarged to include Denmark (including Greenland), Ireland, and the United Kingdom.[37] Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum. The Ostpolitik and the ensuing détente led to establishment of a first truly pan-European body, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), predecessor of the modern Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held.[38] Greece joined in 1981. In 1985, Greenland left the Communities, following a dispute over fishing rights. During the same year, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states.[39] In 1986, the Single European Act was signed. Portugal and Spain joined in 1986.[40] In 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the communities as part of a reunified Germany.[41]

The European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty—whose main architects were Horst Köhler,[42] Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand—came into force on 1 November 1993.[19][43] The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred to as such before the treaty. With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.[44]

[Summary: The European Union expanded significantly during this period, first incorporating Austria, Finland, and Sweden in 1995, followed by its largest enlargement to date in 2004, which added ten new countries. Furthermore, the euro was introduced as physical currency in 2002 across 12 member states, establishing itself as the world's second-largest reserve currency and subsequently expanding the eurozone to 20 countries.]

In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU. In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the eurozone has increased to encompass 20 countries. The euro currency became the second-largest reserve currency in the world. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the union.[45]

On 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the EU, merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality, created a permanent president of the European Council, the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy, and strengthened the position of the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy.[46][47]

Crucially, the segment details the UK's withdrawal (Brexit), which began with a 2016 referendum and concluded when the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020.]

In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for having "contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy, and human rights in Europe".[48][49] In 2013, Croatia became the 28th EU member.[50] From the beginning of the 2010s, the cohesion of the European Union has been tested by several issues, including a debt crisis in some of the eurozone countries, a surge in asylum seekers in 2015, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.[51] A referendum in the UK on its membership of the European Union was held in 2016, with 51.9 per cent of participants voting to leave.[52] The UK formally notified the European Council of its decision to leave on 29 March 2017, initiating the formal withdrawal procedure for leaving the EU; following extensions to the process, the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, although most areas of EU law continued to apply to the UK for a transition period which lasted until 31 December 2020.[53]

[Summary: The early 2020s saw internal changes within the EU, including Denmark abolishing an opt-out and Croatia adopting the euro. Following the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, EU leaders took the unprecedented step of creating common debt to finance the European Recovery Program, Next Generation EU (NGEU). Additionally, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the EU imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and provided military aid to Ukraine funded through the European Peace Facility.]

The early 2020s saw Denmark abolishing one of its three opt-outs and Croatia adopting the euro. After the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU leaders agreed for the first time to create common debt to finance the European Recovery Program called Next Generation EU (NGEU).[54] On 24 February 2022, after massing on the borders of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces undertook an attempt for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[55][56] The European Union imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and agreed on a pooled military aid package to Ukraine for lethal weapons funded via the European Peace Facility off-budget instrument.[57]

[Summary: The Next Generation EU (NGEU) is a €750 billion European Commission economic recovery package, adopted in December 2020, designed to help member states recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and operate between 2021 and 2026. Looking forward, the EU is prioritizing a significant enlargement, aiming to achieve 35 member states by 2030, which requires institutional and budgetary reforms. However, the political environment is unstable, with concerns that the upcoming 2024 elections, influenced by inflation and the war in Ukraine, could undermine crucial EU policies.]

The ancient Roman Agora in Athens illuminated with a Next Generation EU sign
NGEU is a European Commission economic recovery package to support the EU member states to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular those that have been particularly hard hit. It is sometimes styled NextGenerationEU and Next Gen EU, and also called the European Union Recovery Instrument.[58] Agreed in principle by the European Council on 21 July 2020 and adopted on 14 December 2020, the instrument is worth €750 billion. NGEU will operate from 2021 to 2026,[59] and will be tied to the regular 2021–2027 budget of the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The comprehensive NGEU and MFF packages are projected to reach €1824.3 billion.[60]

Preparing the EU for a new great enlargement is one of its political priorities, with the goal of achieving 35 member states by 2030. Institutional and budgetary reforms are being discussed in order for the EU to be ready for the new members.[61][62][63][64] In May 2024, concerns rise, that the outcome of the elections in June, can undermine some of the crucial policies of the EU in the domain of environment, diplomacy, and economy. The war in Ukraine by creating inflation, lowering life level created a possibility of strong changes in the 2024 elections.[65][66]

[Summary: The European integration project, known in French as la construction européenne, began after World War II as sovereign European countries entered into treaties to cooperate and harmonize policies. This integration framework led to the legal inception of the European Union (EU), which inherited its current institutions and responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), founded in the 1950s based on the spirit of the Schuman Declaration.]

Timeline
Since the end of World War II, most sovereign European countries have entered into treaties and thereby co-operated and harmonised policies (or pooled sovereignty) in an increasing number of areas, in the European integration project or the construction of Europe (French: la construction européenne). The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)—the principal framework for this unification. The EU inherited many of its present organizations, institutions, and responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration.

Additionally, lobbying activities by special interest groups at the EU level are regulated to balance private initiatives with public interest decision-making.]

Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms.[69] Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).[g] EU policy is in general promulgated by EU directives, which are then implemented in the domestic legislation of its member states, and EU regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states. Lobbying at the EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process.[70]

[Summary: Through successive enlargements, the European Union (EU) and its predecessors have grown from the six founding states of the EEC to 27 members. Countries accede to the union by becoming a party to the founding treaties, which requires accepting the obligations of membership and entails a partial delegation of sovereignty. This practice, often called "pooling of sovereignty," grants states representation within EU institutions, and member states frequently form strategic alliances internally, such as the Visegrád Group or the Benelux Union.]

Member statesMain article: Member state of the European UnionMap showing the member states of the European Union (clickable)Through successive enlargements, the EU and its predecessors have grown from the six founding states of the EEC to 27 members. Countries accede to the union by becoming a party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".[71][72] In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the union. Examples of such alliances include the Baltic Assembly, the Benelux Union, the Bucharest Nine, the Craiova Group, the EU Med Group, the Lublin Triangle, the New Hanseatic League, the Three Seas Initiative, the Visegrád Group, and the Weimar Triangle.

[Summary: To join the EU, prospective members must satisfy the Copenhagen criteria, defined in 1993, which includes requirements for stable democracy, rule of law, a functioning market economy, and acceptance of EU law, with the European Council overseeing the evaluation process. Separately, the text details the close economic relationships non-EU European states maintain, noting that EFTA countries participate in the single market or have bilateral ties, and microstates like Andorra and Vatican City cooperate, often including the use of the euro.]

To become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.[73]The four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.[74][75] The relationships of the European microstates Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.[76]List of member states in the European Union

[Summary: The governance framework of the European Union dictates that member states retain all powers unless they have collectively agreed to delegate them to the Union, although the exact delimitation of these powers is sometimes disputed. The distribution of legislative competence between the EU and its member states is complex and divided into three categories. These categories include exclusive competence (where member states entirely renounce legislative capacity), shared competence (where member state legislation is limited by EU action), and supporting competence (where the EU can only coordinate or supplement national laws without harmonizing them).]

GovernanceMain articles: Bodies of the European Union and the Euratom, Institutions of the European Union, and Subsidiarity (European Union) § EU competencesMember states retain in principle all powers except those that they have agreed collectively to delegate to the Union as a whole, though the exact delimitation has on occasions become a subject of scholarly or legal disputes.[86][87] In certain fields, members have awarded exclusive competence and exclusive mandate to the Union. These are areas in which member states have entirely renounced their own capacity to enact legislation. In other areas, the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, the member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas, the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.[88] That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area. The distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided into the following three categories:


=== SEGMENT 29 ===
[Summary: The distribution of powers between the European Union (EU) and its member states is categorized into three types: Exclusive, Shared, and Supporting competence. Exclusive competence grants the Union sole power to legislate in fields like the customs union and monetary policy for euro-area states. Shared competence covers broad areas such as the internal market and environment, where member states retain legislative power only if the EU has not already acted. Supporting competence applies to areas like research and humanitarian aid, where EU action does not prevent member states from exercising their own authority.]

Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors.

The high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy (presently Kaja Kallas) also takes part in its meetings. Described by some as the union's "supreme political leadership",[90] it is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies. Its leadership role involves solving disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolving any political crises or disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts as a "collective head of state" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).[91] Tasks for the president of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU,[92] driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU and based in Strasbourg.

The European Commission acts both as the EU's executive arm, responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, and also the legislative initiator, with the sole power to propose laws for debate.[93][94][95] The commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.[96] It has 27 European commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. The leader of the 27 is the president of the European Commission (presently Ursula von der Leyen for 2019–2024, reelected for the 2024–2029 term), proposed by the European Council, following and taking into account the result of the European elections, and is then elected by the European Parliament.[97] The President retains, as the leader responsible for the entire cabinet, the final say in accepting or rejecting a candidate submitted for a given portfolio by a member state, and oversees the commission's permanent civil service.

It consists of a representative from each member state's government and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body. In addition to the legislative functions, members of the council also have executive responsibilities, such as the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and the coordination of broad economic policies within the Union.[103] The Presidency of the council rotates between member states, with each holding it for six months.

[Summary: The European Parliament is one of the EU's three legislative institutions, comprising 705 members (MEPs) who are directly elected every five years via proportional representation and sit according to political groups. The Parliament shares joint legislative approval power with the Council of the European Union over proposals from the European Commission, a process that applies to nearly all areas, including the EU budget. Additionally, the Parliament holds key oversight roles, being the final body to approve the proposed membership of the Commission and having the ability to attempt motions of censure.]

The European Parliament is one of three legislative institutions of the EU, which together with the Council of the European Union is tasked with amending and approving the European Commission's proposals. 705 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation. MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.[104] In the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Commission proposes legislation, which requires the joint approval of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pass. This process applies to nearly all areas, including the EU budget. The parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the Court of Justice. The president of the European Parliament carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally. The president and vice-presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.[105]

The judicial branch of the European Union is formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and consists of two courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court.[106] The Court of Justice is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the CJEU, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its uniform application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court was established in 1952, and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state – currently 27 – although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or fifteen judges. The Court has been led by president Koen Lenaerts since 2015.

[Summary: The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the highest court for Union law, asserting the supremacy of EU law over inconsistent national law. National courts utilize the preliminary reference procedure to seek interpretations of EU law from the CJEU, which they then apply to their specific cases. Additionally, the CJEU functions as an administrative and constitutional court, ensuring the consistent application of EU law and possessing the power to annul unlawful acts committed by EU institutions.]

The CJEU is the highest court of the European Union in matters of Union law. Its case-law provides that EU law has supremacy over any national law that is inconsistent with EU law.[107] It is not possible to appeal against the decisions of national courts in the CJEU, but rather national courts refer questions of EU law to the CJEU (a preliminary reference). However, it is ultimately for the national court to apply the resulting interpretation (the preliminary ruling) to the facts of any given case. Although, only courts of final appeal are bound to refer a question of EU law when one is addressed. The treaties give the CJEU the power for consistent application of EU law across the EU as a whole. The court also acts as an administrative and constitutional court between the other EU institutions and the Member States and can annul or invalidate unlawful acts of EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.

Following amendments in October 2024, the General Court now shares jurisdiction with the Court of Justice over preliminary rulings in six specialized areas, including VAT, customs, and passenger compensation.]

The General Court is a constituent court of the European Union. It hears actions taken against the institutions of the European Union by individuals and member states, although certain matters are reserved for the Court of Justice. Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a point of law. Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance. Since the amendments to the Statute of the CJEU in October 2024, the Court of Justice shares its jurisdiction over references for a preliminary ruling with the General Court.[108] The General Court is since then competent to handle preliminary references falling under one of the six following areas: the common system of value added tax; excise duties; the Customs Code; the tariff classification of goods under the Combined Nomenclature; compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding or delay or cancellation of transport services; the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.[109]

The European Central Bank (ECB) is one of the institutions of the monetary branch of the European Union, the prime component of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks. It is one of the world's most important central banks. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy for the eurozone and the European Union, administers the foreign exchange reserves of EU member states, engages in foreign exchange operations, and defines the intermediate monetary objectives and key interest rate of the EU. The ECB Executive Board enforces the policies and decisions of the Governing Council, and may direct the national central banks when doing so. The ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ECB beforehand. The bank also operates the T2 (RTGS) payments system. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) consists of the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of all 27 member states of the European Union. The ESCB is not the monetary authority of the eurozone, because not all EU member states have joined the euro. The ESCB's objective is price stability throughout the European Union. Secondarily, the ESCB's goal is to improve monetary and financial cooperation between the Eurosystem and member states outside the eurozone.

[Summary: The European Union is considered less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right, with sovereignty flowing from the individual member states rather than a single whole. This limited integration is maintained by member states retaining control over foundational elements, such as the ability to amend treaties (Kompetenz-kompetenz), control over armed force and taxation, and the right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Furthermore, the principle of subsidiarity ensures that only matters requiring collective determination are handled at the EU level.]

The EU is less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several peoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single undifferentiated whole. This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called Kompetenz-kompetenz); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of subsidiarity requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined.


=== SEGMENT 47 ===
[Summary: The European Union operates under the principle of supremacy, which requires national courts to enforce ratified EU treaties, potentially overriding conflicting national or even constitutional law. This doctrine, along with direct effect, was not explicitly defined in the treaties but was developed by the Court of Justice during the 1960s, influenced by judges like Robert Lecourt. The EU's primary law consists of a series of power-giving treaties that establish institutions, set policy goals, and grant the EU legal personality, allowing it to enact legislation that directly affects all member states.]

Under the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.[i] The direct effect and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman Robert Lecourt.[120] The question whether the secondary law enacted by the EU has a comparable status in relation to national legislation, has been a matter of debate among legal scholars.Primary lawThe European Union is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.[121] These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation[j] which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.[k] The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.[122]

[Summary: The main legal acts of the European Union's secondary law are regulations, directives, and decisions.

Decisions are targeted legal acts applying only to specific entities or member states, and notably, all three forms of secondary law are of equal legal value.]

Secondary lawThe main legal acts of the European Union come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,[l] and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.[j] Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.[m] When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states. Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.[123]

[Summary: Foreign policy cooperation among EU member states began in 1957, focusing initially on negotiating international trade as a bloc under the common commercial policy. More wide-ranging coordination started informally in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation (EPC). The EPC was formalized by the Single European Act in 1987 and subsequently renamed the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.]

Foreign relationsMain article: Foreign relations of the European UnionSee also: European External Action ServicePortrait of Kaja KallasKaja Kallas,High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyForeign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the EU's common commercial policy.[124] Steps for more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.[125]

[Summary: The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) aims to promote EU interests, international cooperation, human rights, and democracy, but requires unanimity among member states for policy decisions. The CFSP is coordinated by the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, who articulates common positions and leads the European External Action Service (EEAS). The EEAS, operational since December 1, 2010, functions as the EU's foreign ministry and diplomatic corps.]

The stated aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.[126] The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq.[127]The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The high representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department[128] that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.[129] The EEAS serves as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union.[130]

[Summary: The European Union's international influence is significantly boosted by its enlargement policy, as the appeal of membership acts as a powerful incentive for political and economic reforms in applicant states. This influence on the internal affairs of other countries, which contributed notably to reforms in formerly Communist European countries, is commonly referred to as "soft power," contrasting with military "hard power."]

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.[131]: 762  This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as "soft power", as opposed to military "hard power".[132]Humanitarian aidFurther information: Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid OperationsThe European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, or

[Summary: The European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, known as ECHO, provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2012, ECHO's budget was €874 million, with 51 per cent allocated to Africa and significant portions going to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. This aid is financed 70 per cent by the general budget and 30 per cent by the European Development Fund, utilizing geographic instruments such as the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI).]

"ECHO", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2012, its budget amounted to €874 million, 51 per cent of the budget went to Africa and 20 per cent to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20 per cent to the Middle East and Mediterranean.[133] Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70 per cent) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30 per cent).[134] The EU's external action financing is divided into geographic instruments and thematic instruments.[134] The geographic instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95 per cent of its budget on official development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes.[134]

[Summary: The European Union employs the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) as a foreign relations instrument aimed at strengthening ties with countries situated to the east and south of its European territory. The ENP offers financial assistance to these primarily developing nations, many of whom seek closer integration or eventual EU membership. However, this assistance is strictly conditional upon the target country meeting requirements for government and economic reform, a process formalized through an agreed Action Plan between the country and Brussels.]

The European Union uses foreign relations instruments like the European Neighbourhood Policy which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union, or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.

[Summary: The European Union utilizes the worldwide European Union Global Strategy alongside its other foreign relations instruments. This strategy operates within a context of growing international recognition of sustainable development, which has been acknowledged at major UN summits in 1992, 2002, and 2012. Further global efforts include the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, whose Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) mandate action across five key areas: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership.]

There is also the worldwide European Union Global Strategy. International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily. Its role was recognised in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa; and the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements are the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognise that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas – people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership – in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity.

[Summary: The EU's security framework involves 23 members belonging to NATO, while remaining members follow neutrality policies. Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council decided the EU needed autonomous military capacity, leading to efforts like the Helsinki Headline Goal process and the EU Battlegroups initiative, where each battlegroup is planned to deploy about 1,500 personnel. Furthermore, the 2022 EU Strategic Compass reaffirmed the partnership with NATO and committed to forming a 5,000-strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity.]

Twenty-three EU members are members of NATO while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.[143] The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, closed in 2011[144] as its role had been transferred to the EU.[145] Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel.[146] The EU Strategic Compass adopted in 2022 reaffirmed the bloc's partnership with NATO, committed to increased military mobility and formation of a 5,000-strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity[147]

[Summary: The European Union initially approached environmental issues by framing them as trade barriers and competitive distortions within the Common Market due to differing national standards. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was formally established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987. Since then, the EU has expanded its scope, demonstrating leadership in global environmental governance—such as securing the Kyoto Protocol's ratification—and its laws have significantly improved habitat protection, air and water quality, and waste management across Europe.]

European policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem.[158] Trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state.[160] In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.[159]Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,[161] which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.[158] EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.[159]

[Summary: Mitigating climate change is a top priority of EU environmental policy, characterized by specific targets and economic mechanisms. In 2007, member states agreed to targets for 2020, including achieving 20 percent renewable energy use and reducing CO2 emissions by at least 20 percent compared to 1990 levels, and the EU has adopted an emissions trading system. Furthermore, proposals for reaching a zero carbon economy by 2050 were suggested, a goal supported by almost all member states at a June 2019 summit.]

Mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20 per cent of the energy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels.[162] In 2017, the EU emitted 9.1 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions.[163] The European Union claims that already in 2018, its GHG emissions were 23% lower than in 1990.[164]The EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy.[165] The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city. In the 2019 elections to the European Parliament, the green parties increased their power, possibly because of the rise of post materialist values.[166] Proposals to reach a zero carbon economy in the European Union by 2050 were suggested in 2018–2019. Almost all member states supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland disagreed.[167]

In June 2021, the European Union passed a European Climate Law with targets of 55% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.[168] Also in the same year, the European Union and the United States pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The pledge is considered as a big achievement for climate change mitigation.[169] A research report from November 2024 declared that the Czech Republic is the EU's most toxic country in Europe for care emissions.[170]In 2025, The European Union together with China, Brazil and others, joined the Global carbon market coalition.[171] According to some calculations, a global carbon market can speed up emission reduction seven-fold.[172]

The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level, as agreed in the European Fiscal Pact.

[Summary: The European Union Customs Union establishes a common external tariff for all incoming goods, ensuring that once admitted, these goods circulate internally without being subject to customs duties, discriminatory taxes, or import quotas. Notably, non-EU states like Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland participate in the single market but are excluded from the customs union. The EU represents all its members at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and handles disputes, but trade agreements negotiated outside the WTO framework require approval from each individual EU member state government.]

Customs unionMain article: European Union Customs UnionEuropean Customs Union  EU member states  Non-EU states which participateThe customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union.[74] Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.[190]The European Union Association Agreement does something similar for a much larger range of countries, partly as a so-called soft approach ('a carrot instead of a stick') to influence the politics in those countries. The European Union represents all its members at the World Trade Organization (WTO), and acts on behalf of member states in any disputes. When the EU negotiates trade related agreement outside the WTO framework, the subsequent agreement must be approved by each individual EU member state government.[191]

[Summary: The EU enforces a robust competition policy aimed at ensuring undistorted competition within the single market, exemplified by its prevention of the 2001 General Electric and Honeywell merger and the imposition of a fine exceeding €777 million against Microsoft. Regarding external commerce, the European Union is the world's largest exporter and maintains numerous free trade agreements, having seen its services trade surplus grow substantially; notably, China replaced the United States as the EU's largest trading partner in 2020.]

Competition and consumer protectionMain articles: European Union competition law and European consumer lawSee also: European Union Intellectual Property OfficeThe EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.[o] In 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (General Electric and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority.[192] Another high-profile case, against Microsoft, resulted in the commission fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action.[193]External tradeMain article: Common Commercial Policy (EU)EU free trade agreements  European Union  Agreement in force  Agreement (in part) provisionally appliedThe European Union has concluded free trade agreements (FTAs)[194] and other agreements with a trade component with many countries worldwide and is negotiating with many others.[195] The European Union's services trade surplus rose from $16 billion in 2000 to more than $250 billion in 2018.[196] In 2020, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China became the EU's largest trading partner, displacing the United States.[197] The European Union is the largest exporter in the world[198] and in 2008 was the largest importer of goods and services.[199][200]

[Summary: Internal EU trade is facilitated by eliminating barriers such as tariffs and border controls, alongside the benefit of currency unity within the eurozone. Externally, the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, signed in 2018 and effective in 2019, became the world's largest bilateral free trade deal, covering nearly one-third of global GDP. Regarding energy, the EU's total supply was 59 billion GJ in 2019, relying heavily on imports for approximately three fifths of its needs, while its mandatory comprehensive energy policy was approved in October 2005.]

Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as tariffs and border controls. In the eurozone, trade is helped by not having any currency differences to deal with amongst most members.[191] Externally, the EU's free-trade agreement with Japan is perhaps its most notable one. The EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement was officially signed on 17 July 2018, becoming the world's largest bilateral free trade deal when it went into effect on 1 February 2019, creating an open trade zone covering nearly one-third of global GDP.[201][202]EnergyMain article: Energy policy of the European UnionSee also: European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy RegulatorsTotal energy supply (2019)[203]Oil (31.7%)Natural gas (24.7%)Coal (10.9%)Nuclear (13.2%)Biofuels, waste, electricity, heat (19.4%)The total energy supply of the EU was 59 billion GJ in 2019, about 10.2 per cent of the world total. Approximately three fifths of the energy available in the EU came from imports (mostly of fossil fuels). Renewable energy contributed 18.1 per cent of the EU's total energy supply in 2019, and 11.1 per cent of the final energy consumption.[204] The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.[205]

[Summary: The European Union's energy policy is structured around five key objectives: increasing internal market competition and grid interconnections, diversifying resources, establishing cooperation frameworks (especially with Russia, Central Asia, and North Africa), improving efficiency, and increasing funding for new technologies. Despite these efforts, the EU exhibited high import dependence in 2007, particularly for uranium (97.48%), oil (82%), and natural gas (57%). The EU heavily relies on Russia, Norway, and Algeria for natural gas imports, a dependence on Russian energy it is actively trying to reduce.]

Energy CommunityThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia[206] and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.[205]In 2007, EU countries as a whole imported 82 per cent of their oil, 57 per cent of their natural gas[207] and 97.48 per cent of their uranium[208] demands. The three largest suppliers of natural gas to the European Union are Russia, Norway and Algeria, that amounted for about three quarters of the imports in 2019.[209] There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been attempting to reduce.[210]

Concurrently, the EU manages extensive cross-border infrastructure through the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), established in 1990. The TEN-T consists of a Core Network set for completion by 2030 and a Comprehensive Network targeted for completion by 2050, comprising nine core corridors.]

In May 2022, it was reported that the European Union was preparing another sanction against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. It is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks, as well as individuals and companies. According to an article by Reuters, two diplomats stated that the European Union may impose a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022.[211] Also in May 2022, the European Commission published the RePowerEU initiative, a €300 billion plan outlining the path towards the end of EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2030 and the acceleration on the clean energy transition.[212]TransportMain article: Transport in the European UnionFurther information: Trans-European Transport NetworkSee also: European Union Aviation Safety Agency, European Maritime Safety Agency, and European Union Agency for RailwaysMap of the Trans-European Transport NetworkThe European Union manages cross-border road, railway, airport and water infrastructure through the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), created in 1990,[213] and the Trans-European Combined Transport network.

Air transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Airport network. European airports are categorised as international, community, or regional. The Charles de Gaulle Airport is the busiest in the EU, located in and near the city of Paris, in France.[216] The European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) is a single market in aviation. ECAA agreements were signed on 5 May 2006 in Salzburg, Austria between the EU and some third countries. The ECAA liberalises the air transport industry by allowing any company from any ECAA member state to fly between any ECAA member states airports, thereby allowing a "foreign" airline to provide domestic flights. The Single European Sky (SES) is an initiative that seeks to reform the European air traffic management system through a series of actions carried out in four different levels (institutional, operational, technological and control and supervision) with the aim of satisfying the needs of the European airspace in terms of capacity, safety, efficiency and environmental impact. Civil aviation safety is under the responsibility of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It carries out certification, regulation and standardisation and also performs investigation and monitoring. The idea of a European-level aviation safety authority goes back to 1996, but the agency was only legally established in 2002, and began operating in 2003.Rail transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Rail network, made up of the high-speed rail n

The Schengen Area is an area comprising 29 European countries that have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders. Being an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice policy of the EU, it mostly functions as a single jurisdiction under a common visa policy for international travel purposes. The area is named after the 1985 Schengen Agreement and the 1990 Schengen Convention, both signed in Schengen, Luxembourg. Of the 27 EU member states, 25 participate in the Schengen Area. Of the EU members that are not part of the Schengen Area, one—Cyprus—is legally obligated to join the area in the future; Ireland maintains an opt-out, and instead operates its own visa policy. The four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, are not members of the EU, but have signed agreements in association with the Schengen Agreement. Also, three European microstates – Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City – maintain open borders for passenger traffic with their neighbours, and are therefore considered de facto members of the Schengen Area due to the practical impossibility of travelling to or from them without transiting through at least one Schengen member country.

This was the first common political framework for space activities established by the EU. Each member state has pursued to some extent their own national space policy, though often co-ordinating through the ESA. Günter Verheugen, the European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, has stated that even though the EU is "a world leader in the technology", it was "being put on the defensive by the United States and Russia and that it only has about a 10-year technological advantage on China and India, which are racing to catch up".

Additionally, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), a satellite-based augmentation system, currently supplements GPS but is planned to supplement Galileo in a future version.]

Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that went live in 2016, created by the EU through the ESA, operated by the EUSPA, with two ground operations centres in Fucino, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The €10 billion project is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European political and military authorities do not have to rely on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) developed by the ESA and EUROCONTROL. Currently, it supplements the GPS by reporting on the reliability and accuracy of their positioning data and sending out corrections. The system will supplement Galileo in a future version.

The CAP, introduced in 1962, involves agricultural subsidies and has seen its budgetary cost decline significantly since 1985, although it still faces criticism regarding its cost and environmental effects. The CFP, formally established in 2009 by the Treaty of Lisbon, manages fishing quotas for member states and is enshrined as one of the EU's exclusive competences for conservation.]

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has since then undergone several changes to reduce the EEC budget cost (from 73% in 1985 to 37% in 2017) and consider rural development in its aims. It has, however, been criticised on the grounds of its cost and its environmental and humanitarian effects.Likewise, the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union. It sets quotas for which member states are allowed to catch each type of fish, as well as encouraging the fishing industry by various market interventions and fishing subsidies. It was introduced in 2009 with the Treaty of Lisbon, which formally enshrined fisheries conservation policy as one of the handful of "exclusive competences" reserved for the European Union.

The EU also seeks to protect workers' rights and prevent social dumping by adopting minimum standards, such as the Working Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, and recently approved the European Directive about Minimum Wage in September 2022. Unemployment varied greatly across the union; for example, in September 2018, the EU rate was 6.7% while the euro area rate was 8.1%.]

LabourSee also: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, European Labour Authority, European Training Foundation, and EURESThe free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.[220] The EU seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent in September 2018.[221] The euro area unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent.[221] Among the member states, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3 per cent), Germany and Poland (both 3.4 per cent), and the highest in Spain (10.61 per cent in 2024)[222] and Greece (9.6 per cent in November 2024).[223] The European Union has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting workers' rights and preventing social and environmental dumping.[citation needed] To this end, it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the Working Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The European Directive about Minimum Wage, which looks to lift minimum wages and strengthen collective bargaining was approved by the European Parliament in September 2022.[224]

Therefore, official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens have the right to correspond with the institutions in these languages.[242][243] There are about 150 regional and minority languages in the EU, spoken by up to 50 million people.[244] The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage. The European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe.[245]

[Summary: As of 2015, the EU population was predominantly Christian (71.6%), with Catholicism being the largest single denomination (45.3%), while 24.0% of the population identified as irreligious. Institutionally, the EU has no formal connection to any religion, although Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognizes the status of religious and non-confessional organizations under national law. Discussions to include explicit mention of Christianity or a god in the preambles of the European Constitution and the Treaty of Lisbon were dropped due to opposition.]

Man: The EU has no formal connection to any religion. Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union[246] recognises the "status under national law of churches and religious associations" as well as that of "philosophical and non-confessional organisations".[247] The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe".[247][248] Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or a god, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.[249]

[Summary: The religious landscape of the EU is highly diverse, incorporating various Christian denominations (Catholics, Protestants, Eastern Orthodox), along with significant Muslim and Jewish populations, and followers of other world religions. While a 2005 Eurobarometer poll indicated that 52% of EU citizens believed in a god, levels of belief vary dramatically across member states, being highest in Malta, Cyprus, and Romania, and lowest in Estonia and the Czech Republic.]

Christians in the EU include Catholics of both Roman and Eastern Rite, numerous Protestant denominations with Lutherans, Anglicans, and Reformed forming the majority of Protestant affiliations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million,[250] and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.[251] The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population. Eurostat's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52 per cent of EU citizens believed in a god, 27 per cent in "some sort of spirit or life force", and 18 per cent had no form of belief.[252]Man: Into the 21st century, many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership.[253] The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16 per cent) and the Czech Republic (19 per cent).[252] The most religious countries were Malta (95 per cent, predominantly Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90 per cent of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16, and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale".[252]

[Summary: The European Union's role in basic education is primarily limited to supporting national governments. However, in higher education, the EU developed policies focusing on exchanges and mobility starting in the 1980s. The most visible result is the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange program which began in 1987 and supported over 1.5 million students in its first 20 years.]

In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years, it supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and became a symbol of European student life.[254]

[Summary: The EU supports various educational exchange programs, including the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013, which target school pupils, teachers, trainees, and adult learners to spread good practices and encourage cross-border knowledge. In higher education, the EU supports the Bologna Process to ensure compatible degrees, and facilitates scientific research through Framework Programmes (the first starting in 1984) aimed at coordinating research and addressing specific issues like developing renewable energy sources.]

There are similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.[255][256] Through its support of the Bologna Process, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe. Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.[257] EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.[258]

[Summary: The EU works to coordinate member states' social security and health systems to ensure individuals exercising free movement rights maintain access to services across the Union. Simultaneously, the EU has strengthened its focus on equality, establishing the European Institute for Gender Equality (2007) and a European Commissioner for equality (2019), while also approving the first EU Strategy on LGBTIQ equality (2020) and a European Care strategy (2022). The European Social Charter serves as the main body recognizing the social rights of European citizens.]

Social rights and equalityMain articles: European social model, European Social Fund Plus, Welfare State, European Social Charter, European Voluntary Service, European labour law, List of countries by guaranteed minimum income, European Pillar of Social Rights, and List of European Union member states by minimum wageThe EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states. Since 2019 there has been a European commissioner for equality and the European Institute for Gender Equality has existed since 2007. A Directive on countering gender-based violence has been proposed.[268][269] In September 2022, a European Care strategy was approved in order to provide "quality, affordable and accessible care services".[270] The European Social Charter is the main body that recognises the social rights of European citizens. In 2020, the first ever European Union Strategy on LGBTIQ equality was approved under Helena Dalli mandate.[271] In December 2021, the commission announced the intention of codifying a union-wide law against LGBT hate crimes.[272]

[Summary: The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides EU citizens with a wide array of political, social, and economic rights. Since its creation in 1993, the EU has significantly developed its competencies in justice and home affairs, transitioning from an intergovernmental level to supranationalism. Consequently, the union now legislates in critical areas such as extradition, family law, asylum law, and criminal justice.]

[Summary: The EU has established agencies like Europol, CEPOL, and Eurojust, along with various databases, to coordinate police, prosecution, and civil litigation across member states. Furthermore, EU treaties declare the union is founded on values including human dignity, democracy, and equality, granting it powers to legislate against discrimination based on factors such as race, religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation.]

The EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecution and civil litigations across the member states: Europol for police co-operation, CEPOL for training of police forces[277] and the Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors and courts.[278] It also operates the EUCARIS database of vehicles and drivers, the Eurodac, the European Criminal Records Information System, the European Cybercrime Centre, FADO, PRADO and others.Prohibitions against discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.[s] The treaties declare that the European Union itself is "founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."[279] By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexism in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.[t]

[Summary: The Lisbon Treaty, enacted in 2009, gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, establishing a codified catalogue of rights used to judge the legality of EU acts and consolidating rights previously recognized by the Court of Justice. Additionally, while signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership, the Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR changed prior limitations, binding the EU itself to accede to the convention.]

In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states".[280] The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.[281] Signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership.[u] Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state[v] nor had the competence to accede.[w] The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it.


=== SEGMENT 103 ===
[Summary: The European Union operates independently of the Council of Europe, though they share common goals regarding the rule of law and human rights, and the Council of Europe created foundational texts like the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU actively promotes human rights globally, notably requiring the abolition of the death penalty as a condition for membership and proposing its worldwide abolition. In October 2020, the EU announced new plans to establish a legal structure that would allow it greater flexibility to target and sanction individuals responsible for serious human rights violations around the world.]

The EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas, especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Furthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.[282] On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to create a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses around the world.[283]

[Summary: Sport is generally the responsibility of EU member states or international organizations, although EU policies, such as the free movement of workers, have significantly impacted the sector, most notably through the Bosman ruling which prohibited quotas on foreign players holding EU citizenship. Furthermore, the Treaty of Lisbon mandates that the application of economic rules must consider the specific, often voluntary, nature of sport and its structures, a requirement that followed lobbying efforts by governing bodies like the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and FIFA.]

Sport
Main article: Sport policies of the European Union
Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. There are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU member state citizenship.[288] The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.[289] This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.[290] The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.[291]

The flag of Europe consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background. Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present European Union, in 1986. The Council of Europe gave the flag a symbolic description in the following terms,[292] although the official symbolic description adopted by the EU omits the reference to the "Western world".[293]

Against the blue sky of the Western world, the stars symbolise the peoples of Europe in a form of a circle, the sign of union. The number of stars is invariably twelve, the figure twelve being the symbol of perfection and entirety.

[Summary: This segment details key symbols and observances of the European Union, noting that Europe Day, celebrated on May 9th to commemorate the 1950 Schuman Declaration, has served as the union's flag day since 1985. The EU's anthem is the instrumental prelude to the "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's ninth symphony, also adopted in 1985. Additionally, the Greek mythological figure Europa and the accompanying bull are utilized symbolically, appearing on EU institutions, the 2013 euro banknotes, and all residence permit cards.]

Since 1985, the flag day of the union has been Europe Day, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 Schuman declaration). The anthem of the EU is an instrumental version of the prelude to the Ode to Joy, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions.[295] Besides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the EU's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of euro banknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.[296]

[Summary: Although the majority of media within the European Union remains nationally oriented, several EU-wide outlets focusing on European affairs, such as Euronews and Politico Europe, have emerged since the early 1990s, alongside specialized support like the Franco-German Arte TV network and the EU's MEDIA Programme for audiovisual industries. Economically, the EU has shown significant positive influence; a 2019 study indicated that member states joining between 1973 and 2004 experienced, on average, per capita incomes approximately 10% higher in their first decade due to European integration.]

The majority of media in the European Union are national-orientated, although some EU-wide media focusing on European affairs have emerged since the early 1990s, such as Euronews, Eurosport, EUobserver, EURACTIV or Politico Europe.[304][305] Arte is a public Franco-German TV network that promotes programming in the areas of culture and the arts. 80 per cent of its programming are provided in equal proportion by the two member companies, while the remainder is being provided by the European Economic Interest Grouping ARTE GEIE and the channel's European partners.[306] The MEDIA Programme of the European Union has supported the European popular film and audiovisual industries since 1991. It provides support for the development, promotion and distribution of European works within Europe and beyond.[307]

Influence

The European Union has had a significant positive economic effect on most member states.[308] According to a 2019 study of the member states who joined from 1973 to 2004, "without European integration, per capita incomes would have been, on average, approximately 10% lower in the first ten years after joining the EU".[308] Greece was the exception reported by the study, which analysed up to 2008, "to avoid confounding effects from the global financial crisis".[308]

[Summary: This segment analyzes the economic and political influence of the European Union, noting that the 2004 enlargement had aggregate beneficial economic effects on all member states, especially unskilled labor in the new states. The EU is widely credited with promoting peace and anchoring democracy in Eastern Europe post-USSR collapse. However, critics argue that the EU may inadvertently aid democratic backsliding by providing funds and being reluctant to intervene, although mechanisms like Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union may constrain electoral autocracies.]

A 2021 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that the 2004 enlargement had aggregate beneficial economic effects on all groups in both the old and new member states. The largest winners were the new member states, in particular unskilled labour in the new member states.[309]

The European Union is frequently cited as having made a major contribution to peace in Europe, in particular by pacifying border disputes,[310][311] and to the spread of democracy, especially by encouraging democratic reforms in aspiring Eastern European member states after the collapse of the USSR.[312][313] Scholar Thomas Risse wrote in 2009, "there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that the EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new democracies."[313] However, R. Daniel Kelemen argues that the EU has proved beneficial to leaders who are overseeing democratic backsliding, as the EU is reluctant to intervene in domestic politics, gives authoritarian governments funds which they can use to strengthen their regimes, and because freedom of movement within the EU allows dissenting citizens to leave their backsliding countries. At the same time, the union might provide through Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union an external constraint that prevents electoral autocracies, currently Hungary,[314] from progressing into closed autocracies.[315]
