  You are a document segmentation expert. Your task is to divide the following text into logical, coherent segments.

  ### GUIDELINES:
  - Each segment should represent a complete thought or topic
  - Segments should be roughly {{minSegmentLength}}-{{maxSegmentLength}} characters long
  - Preserve all original text without modification
  - Break at natural boundaries (paragraphs, section breaks, topic changes)
  - Do not add, remove, or modify any content
  - Return segments in their original order

  ### TEXT TO SEGMENT:
  {{text}}

  ### IMPORTANT:

  Segments MUST be {{minSegmentLength}}-{{maxSegmentLength}} characters.
