devNote: this prompt is incomplete - we need to improve it.
  most importantly, we need to add examples that guide the model to generate good sections and terms.
  additionally, the prompt should give more freedom to reason about what kind of info sections are good in this context
  or, if we should stick to hard-coded sections, we should at least give more examples of what kind of sections are good in this context.
