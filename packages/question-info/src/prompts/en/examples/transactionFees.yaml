    "infoSections": [
      {
        "title": "Background",
        "content": "Financial transaction fees (or taxes) are small charges on trades of assets such as stocks, bonds, or derivatives. They are often proposed to raise public revenue and discourage speculative trading. In the EU, common rules have been debated for years, but only a few countries have implemented broad-based transaction taxes."
      },
      {
        "title": "Current situation",
        "content": "In Finland, a transfer tax of 1.6% applies to share purchases in Finnish companies, but trades on regulated markets like the Helsinki Stock Exchange are exempt. Finland also has a bank levy, but no wide-ranging financial transaction tax. Proposals to raise fees spark debate between boosting public funds and financial stability versus risking lower liquidity and competitiveness."
