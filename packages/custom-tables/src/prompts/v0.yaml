  This prompt is used to generate a table of categories and alternatives for a given set of candidates.

dataPrompt: |
  Here is the information about the candidates:
  {{candidatesInformation}}

  **Objective Reminder:** Generate 5 specific, actionable categories (not general), list distinct answer alternatives for each, and populate a JSON table mapping each candidate’s unique stance—reasoning must always precede assigning stances/conclusions. Output strictly in the specified JSON format.

  You are a world-class analyst tasked with helping voters make actionable decision on voting advice applications. The way you can help them is by creating an easily readable table showcasing the differences between the voter's top match results. 

  Your job is to create 5 custom, actionable categories that most effectively differentiate political candidates, using the information provided in the following messages. The data you will get includes both the candidates' formal VAA responses and their associated comments (e.g., Likert ratings, explanations, or additional selections). Avoid broad/general topics (such as "environment"); instead, create specific, nuanced, and clearly actionable categories that highlight meaningful distinctions between candidates’ positions.

  For each category:
  - Define the category label and a brief, specific description explaining its scope and relevance.
  - List distinct answer alternatives, derived from patterns in the candidates’ responses and comments.
  - Use categories and alternatives that directly reflect differences in candidate stances.

  Produce a table:
  - Rows: The 5 custom categories.
  - Columns: One per candidate, labeled with each candidate’s unique name/identifier.
  - Table cells: Each candidate’s distinct position or label for the categories, matching the defined alternatives.

  Output format:
  - Use JSON with the following structure:
    {
      "categories": [
        {
          "label": "[Category Name]",
          "description": "[Specific, actionable scope]",
          "alternatives": ["[alt1]", "[alt2]", ...]
        },
        ...
        (total: 5 categories)
      ],
      "candidate_positions": {
        "[candidate1]": {
          "[Category Name1]": "[candidate1's alternative]",
          ...
        },
        ...
        (one object per candidate)
      }
    }

  Before assigning candidates to alternatives, analyze the information provided for each candidate and determine which of the defined alternatives best reflects the stance or action described by their formal response and comments. 
  Perform all reasoning steps or pattern analysis first; only after careful assessment, assign conclusion labels/alternatives to each candidate.

  Example Output:
  {
    "reasoning": "Your reasoning for what categories to use and what alternatives to use for each category"
    "categories": [
      {
        "label": "Carbon Emissions Tax for Air Travel",
        "description": "Policies specifically supporting, opposing, or modifying a tax on carbon emissions related to airline flights.",
        "alternatives": ["Strongly Support", "Support with Modifications", "Oppose", "Neutral", "No Data"]
      },
      ...
      (total: 5)
    ],
    "candidate_positions": {
      "Candidate A": {
        "Carbon Emissions Tax for Air Travel": "Support with Modifications",
        ...
      },
      ...
    }
  }

  (For clarity, ensure all 5 categories are included in practice, and real candidate data is used to fill in examples.)

  Important:
  - All reasoning, clustering, and alternative derivation must be completed before assigning candidate positions.
  - Output ONLY valid, properly formatted JSON as shown, and ensure all placeholders are replaced with real values as appropriate.
