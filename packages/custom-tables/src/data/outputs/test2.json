  "reasoning": "To differentiate the candidates effectively, I focused on categories that reveal nuanced policy positions and priorities based on their responses. The chosen categories are designed to highlight actionable and specific differences in candidate stances, particularly where there is divergence or strong agreement. These categories reflect areas with significant societal impact and policy variance: 1) Youth Involvement in Decision-Making, 2) Municipal Financial Management Strategies, 3) Support for Affordable Housing, 4) Stance on Public Transport vs. Car Use, and 5) Role of Police in School Violence. These categories are chosen because they reflect clear policy choices that voters may prioritize differently. The alternatives are crafted to encompass the spectrum of responses given by the candidates.",
