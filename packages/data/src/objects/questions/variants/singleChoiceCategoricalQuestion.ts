  /**
   * Normalizes the value by splitting the value space into combination of `n` binary choices or dimensions where `n` is the number of choices, unless `n` is 2, in which case a single dimension suffices. Because of this, categorical questions will **only yield distances of `[0, 2/n]` where `n` is the number of choices**, i.e., for the favourite color example, the match score can only be 100% in case of agreement or ~33% for disagreement. For binary questions, the range is 0â€“100%.
   * This behavior is semantically motivated by the treatment of the questions as binary choices. In the example, this would map to in case of A answering "red" and B, "blue":
   * - Red is favored?:   A yes, B no  => disagree
   * - Blue is favored?:  A no,  B yes => disagree
   * - Green is favored?: A no,  B no  => agree
   * Thus, the respondents disagree on two counts but agree on one. In contrast, had they given the same answer, agreement would be perfect regardless of the number of choices.
   * If such behavior limited in the level of disagreement is not what you want, this can be partially remedied by increasing the question weight to `n/2`. Note, however, that this will correct its weighting compared to other questions, but it will not yield full disagreement when looking at the question in isolation because the matching algorithm will normalise the distance using the maximum possible distance after computing it.
