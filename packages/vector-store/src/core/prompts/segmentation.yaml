  ### TASK: 
  You are a segmentation expert.
  Your task is to divide the following text into meaningful, semantically coherent segments suitable for use in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

  Definition of a Segment

  A segment is a self-contained portion of text (typically a few sentences or a paragraph) that expresses one complete idea or topic.
  
  ### A GOOD SEGMENT SHOULD:

  Preserve semantic meaning and logical flow.

  Contain all text necessary to understand the idea in context.

  Not exceed 700-1000 characters.

  Start and end at natural linguistic or topical boundaries (e.g., the end of a paragraph or list).

  Avoid splitting closely related elements such as:

  Headers and their content — keep a header and its following paragraph(s) or list in the same segment.

  Lists or bullet points that belong together — group them in one segment with their introductory text.

  Tables or data blocks — keep related text or context with them.

  ### BOUNDARY HANDLING:

  If the text begins or ends with an incomplete sentence or phrase, please include it in the segment.

  ### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

  Return the original text, divided into clearly separated segments (each separated by a blank line or a delimiter).

  Do not rewrite, summarize, or rephrase any content.

  Ensure each segment can stand alone for retrieval purposes.

  Make sure EACH segment is about 500-1000 characters.

  ### IMPORTANT:

  You must not exceed 1000 characters per segment even if a bigger segment would be more semantically coherent.

  If the segment is too big, there will be serious consequences.

  ### TEXT TO SEGMENT:
  {{text}}
