  ## SEARCH RESULTS:
  {{searchResults}}

  ## INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Analyze each search result and determine if it's relevant to answering the query
  - A result is relevant if it contains information that DIRECTLY helps answer the query
  - Be selective - include results that provide context or related information
  - Return the indices (0-based) of the results you consider relevant
  - If the query is not related to any of the search results, return an empty array
  - If the query does not require any information to be answered adequately, return an empty array
