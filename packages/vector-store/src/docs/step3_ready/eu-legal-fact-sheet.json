Furthermore, EU law has direct or indirect effect on\nthe laws of its Member States and becomes part of the legal system of each Member\nState. The European Union is in itself a source of law. The legal order is usually\ndivided into primary legislation (the Treaties and general legal principles), secondary\nlegislation (based on the Treaties) and supplementary law.\n\n### SOURCES AND HIERARCHY OF UNION LAW\n- Treaty on European Union (TEU); Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n(TFEU); and their protocols (there are 37 protocols, 2 annexes and 65 declarations,\nwhich are attached to the treaties to fill in details, without being incorporated into\nthe full legal text) 1.1.5;\n- Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 4.1.2\n- The Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) is still\nin force as a separate treaty.\n- International agreements 5.2.1;\n- General principles of Union law;\n- Secondary legislation.\n\nThe Treaties and the general principles are at the top of the hierarchy, and are\nknown as primary legislation. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on\n1 December 2009, the same value was also given to the Charter of Fundamental\nRights. International agreements concluded by the European Union are subordinate to\nprimary legislation. Secondary legislation is the next level down in the hierarchy and is\nvalid only if it is consistent with the acts and agreements which have precedence over it.\n\n### OBJECTIVES\nCreation of a legal order for the Union to achieve the objectives stipulated in the\nTreaties.\n\n### EU SOURCES OF LAW\nA. Primary legislation of the European Union 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4, 1.1.5, 4.1.2\nB. Secondary legislation of the European Union\n\n1. General points\n\nThe legal acts of the Union are listed in Article 288 TFEU. They are regulations,\ndirectives, decisions, recommendations and opinions. EU institutions may adopt legal\nacts of these kinds only if they are empowered to do so by the Treaties. The limits of\nUnion competences are governed by the principle of conferral, which is enshrined in\nArticle 5(1) TEU. The TFEU defines the scope of Union competences, dividing them into\n\nthree categories: exclusive competences (Article 3), shared competences (Article 4)\nand supporting competences (Article 6), whereby the EU adopts measures to support\nor complement Member States' policies. Articles 3, 4 and 6 TFEU list the areas that\ncome under each category of Union competence. In the absence of the necessary\npowers to attain one of the objectives set out in the Treaties, the institutions may apply\nthe provisions of Article 352 TFEU, and thus adopt the 'appropriate measures'.\n\nThe institutions adopt only those legal instruments listed in Article 288 TFEU. The\nonly exceptions are the common foreign, security and defence policies, to which\nthe intergovernmental method still applies. In this area, common strategies, common\nactions and common positions have been replaced by 'general guidelines' and\n'decisions defining' actions to be undertaken and positions to be adopted by the Union,\nand the arrangements for the implementation of those decisions (Article 25 TEU).\n\nThere are, in addition, various forms of action, such as recommendations,\ncommunications and acts on the organisation and running of the institutions (including\ninter-institutional agreements), the designation, structure and legal effects of which\nstem from various provisions in the Treaties or the rules adopted pursuant to the\nTreaties.\n\n2. Hierarchy of EU secondary legislation\n\nA hierarchy of secondary legislation is established by Articles 289, 290 and 291 TFEU\nbetween legislative acts, delegated acts and implementing acts. Legislative acts are\nlegal acts which are adopted through the ordinary or a special legislative procedure.\nDelegated acts for their part are non-legislative acts of general application which\nsupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. The power to\nadopt these acts may be delegated to the Commission by the legislator (Parliament and\nthe Council). The objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power\nare defined in the legislative act, as are any urgent procedures, where applicable. In\naddition, the legislator lays down the conditions to which the delegation is subject, which\nmay be the authority to revoke the delegation or the right to express an objection.\n\nImplementing acts are generally adopted by the Commission, which is competent to\ndo so in cases where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding acts are\nneeded. Implementing acts are a matter for the Council only in specific cases which\nare duly justified and in areas of common foreign and security policy. Where a basic\nact is adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Parliament or\nthe Council may at any time indicate to the Commission that, in its view, a draft\nimplementing act goes beyond the implementing powers provided for in the basic act.\nIn this case, the Commission must revise the draft act in question.\n\n3. The various types of EU secondary legislation\na. Regulations\n\nRegulations are of general application, binding in their entirety and directly applicable.\nThey must be complied with fully by those to whom they apply (private persons, Member\nStates, Union institutions). Regulations are directly applicable in all the Member States\nas soon as they enter into force (on the date stipulated or, failing this, on the twentieth\nday following their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union) and do not\nneed to be transposed into national law.\n\nThey are designed to ensure the uniform application of Union law in all the Member\nStates. Regulations supersede national laws incompatible with their substantive\nprovisions.\n\nb. Directives\n\nDirectives are binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon any or all of the\nMember States to whom they are addressed, but leave to the national authorities\nthe choice of form and methods. National legislators must adopt a transposing act\nor 'national implementing measure' to transpose directives and bring national law\ninto line with their objectives. Individual citizens are given rights and bound by the\nlegal act only once the transposing act has been adopted. Member States are\ngiven some discretion, in transposing directives, to take account of specific national\ncircumstances. Transposition must be effected within the period laid down in the\ndirective. In transposing directives, Member States guarantee the effectiveness of EU\nlaw, in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation established in Article 4(3)\nTEU.\n\nIn principle, directives are not directly applicable. The Court of Justice of the European\nUnion, however, has ruled that certain provisions of a directive may, exceptionally, have\ndirect effects in a Member State even if the latter has not yet adopted a transposing act\nin cases where: (a) the directive has not been transposed into national law or has been\ntransposed incorrectly; (b) the provisions of the directive are imperative and sufficiently\nclear and precise; and (c) the provisions of the directive confer rights on individuals.\n\nIf these conditions have been met, individuals may invoke the provision in question\nin their dealings with the public authorities. Even when the provision does not confer\nany rights on the individual, and only the first and second conditions have been met,\nMember State authorities are required to take account of the untransposed directive.\nThis ruling is based chiefly on the principles of effectiveness, the prevention of Treaty\nviolations and legal protection. On the other hand, an individual may not rely on\nthe direct effect of an untransposed directive in dealings with other individuals (the\n'horizontal effect'; Faccini Dori Case C-91/92, ECR, p. I-3325 et seq., point 25).\n\nAccording to the case law of the Court (Francovich case, joined cases C-6/90 and\nC-9/90), an individual citizen is entitled to seek compensation from a Member State\nwhich is not complying with Union law. This is possible, in the case of a directive which\nhas not been transposed or which has been transposed inadequately, where: (a) the\ndirective is intended to confer rights on individuals; (b) the content of the rights can\nbe identified on the basis of the provisions of the directive; and (c) there is a causal\nlink between the breach of the obligation to transpose the directive and the loss and\ndamage suffered by the injured parties. Fault on the part of the Member State does not\nthen have to be demonstrated in order to establish liability.\n\nC. Decisions, recommendations and opinions\n\nDecisions are binding in their entirety. Where those to whom they are addressed are\nstipulated (Member States, natural or legal persons), they are binding only on them,\nand address situations specific to those Member States or persons. An individual may\ninvoke the rights conferred by a decision addressed to a Member State only if that\nMember State has adopted a transposing act. Decisions may be directly applicable on\nthe same basis as directives.\n\nRecommendations and opinions do not confer any rights or obligations on those to\nwhom they are addressed, but may provide guidance as to the interpretation and\ncontent of Union law.\n\n4. Provisions on competences, procedures, implementation and enforcement of\nlegal acts\na. Legislative competence, right of initiative and legislative procedures: 1.3.2, 1.3.6,\n1.3.8 and 1.2.3\n\nParliament, the Council and the Commission take part in the adoption of the Union's\nlegislation to varying degrees, depending on the individual legal basis. Parliament can\nask the Commission to present legislative proposals to itself and to the Council.\n\nb. Implementation of Union legislation\n\nUnder primary law, the EU has only limited powers of enforcement, as EU law is usually\nenforced by the Member States. Furthermore, Article 291(1) TFEU adds that Member\nStates shall adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding\nUnion acts. Where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are\nneeded, the Commission exercises its implementing powers (Article 291(2) TFEU).\n\nC. Choice of type of legal act\n\nIn many cases, the Treaties lay down the type of legal act to be adopted. In many other\ncases, however, no type of legal act is specified. In these cases, Article 296(1) TFEU\nstates that the institutions must select it on a case-by-case basis, ‘in compliance with\nthe applicable procedures and with the principle of proportionality'.\n\nC. General principles of Union law and fundamental rights\n\nThe Treaties make very few references to the general principles of Union law. These\nprinciples have mainly been developed in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (legal certainty, institutional balance, legitimate expectation, etc.),\nwhich is also the basis for the recognition of fundamental rights as general principles\nof Union law. These principles are now enshrined in Article 6(3) TEU, which refers to\nthe fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human\nRights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions\ncommon to the Member States and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion (4.1.2).\n\nD. International agreements concluded by the European Union\n\nThe Union may, within its sphere of competence, conclude international agreements\nwith third countries or international organisations (Article 216(1) TFEU). These\nagreements are binding on the Union and the Member States, and are an integral part\nof Union law.\n\n### ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n\nUnder Article 14(1) TEU: ‘The European Parliament shall, jointly with the Council,\nexercise legislative (via the ‘ordinary legislative procedure') and budgetary (via a\nspecial legislative procedure under Article 314 TFEU) functions'. Parliament is seeking\nto simplify the legislative process, improve the drafting quality of legal texts and\nensure that more effective penalties are imposed on Member States that fail to\ncomply with Union law. The Commission's Annual Working and Legislative Programme\n\npresents the major political priorities of the Commission and identifies concrete actions,\neither legislative or non-legislative, that translate these priorities into operational\nterms. Parliament plays a genuine role in creating new laws, since it examines the\nCommission's Annual Programme of Work and says which laws it would like to see\nintroduced.\n\nHaving gained legal personality, the Union can now conclude international agreements\n(Article 218 TFEU). Any agreements concluded in the field of the common commercial\npolicy and all fields whose policies fall under the ordinary legislative procedure require\nthe consent of the European Parliament.\n\nUdo Bux\n05/2018\n\n# 2 - THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY - [1.2.2.]\n\nIn areas in which the European Union does not have exclusive competence, the\nprinciple of subsidiarity, laid down in the Treaty on European Union, defines the\ncircumstances in which it is preferable for action to be taken by the Union, rather\nthan the Member States.\n\n### LEGAL BASIS\nArticle 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Protocol (No 2) on the\napplication of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\n\n### OBJECTIVES\nThe principle of subsidiarity and the principle of proportionality govern the exercise of\nthe EU's competences. In areas in which the European Union does not have exclusive\ncompetence, the principle of subsidiarity seeks to safeguard the ability of the Member\nStates to take decisions and action and authorises intervention by the Union when the\nobjectives of an action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can\nbe better achieved at Union level, ‘by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed\naction'. The purpose of including a reference to the principle in the EU Treaties is also\nto ensure that powers are exercised as close to the citizen as possible, in accordance\nwith the proximity principle referred to in Article 10(3) of the TEU.\n\n### ACHIEVEMENTS\nA. Origin and history\n\nThe principle of subsidiarity was formally enshrined by the Maastricht Treaty, which\nincluded a reference to it in the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC).\nThe Single European Act (1987) had already incorporated a subsidiarity criterion into\nenvironmental policy, however, albeit without referring to it explicitly as such. In its\njudgment of 21 February 1995 (T-29/92), the Court of First Instance of the European\nCommunities ruled that the principle of subsidiarity was not a general principle of law,\nagainst which the legality of Community action should have been tested, prior to the\nentry into force of the TEU.\n\nWithout changing the wording of the reference to the principle of subsidiarity in the\nrenumbered Article 5, second paragraph, of the EC Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam\nannexed to the EC Treaty a ‘Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity\nand proportionality'. The overall approach to the application of the principle of\nsubsidiarity agreed at the 1992 European Council in Edinburgh thus became legally\nbinding and subject to judicial review via the protocol on subsidiarity.\n\nThe Lisbon Treaty incorporated the principle of subsidiarity into Article 5(3) TEU\nand repealed the corresponding provision of the TEC while retaining its wording. It\nalso added an explicit reference to the regional and local dimension of the principle\nof subsidiarity. What is more, the Lisbon Treaty replaced the 1997 protocol on the\napplication of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality with a new protocol of\n\nthe same name (Protocol No 2), the main difference being the new role of the national\nparliaments in ensuring compliance with the principle of subsidiarity (1.3.5).\n\nB. Definition\n\nThe general aim of the principle of subsidiarity is to guarantee a degree of\nindependence for a lower authority in relation to a higher body or for a local authority\nin relation to central government. It therefore involves the sharing of powers between\nseveral levels of authority, a principle which forms the institutional basis for federal\nstates.\n\nWhen applied in the context of the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity\nserves to regulate the exercise of the Union's non-exclusive powers. It rules out Union\nintervention when an issue can be dealt with effectively by Member States at central,\nregional or local level and means that the Union is justified in exercising its powers when\nMember States are unable to achieve the objectives of a proposed action satisfactorily\nand added value can be provided if the action is carried out at Union level.\n\nUnder Article 5(3) TEU there are three preconditions for intervention by Union\ninstitutions in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity: (a) the area concerned does\nnot fall within the Union's exclusive competence (i.e. non-exclusive competence); (b)\nthe objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member\nStates (i.e. necessity); (c) the action can therefore, by reason of its scale or effects, be\nimplemented more successfully by the Union (i.e. added value).\n\nC. Scope\n\n1. The demarcation of Union competences\n\nThe principle of subsidiarity applies only to areas in which competence is shared\nbetween the Union and the Member States. Following the entry into force of the\nLisbon Treaty, the competences conferred on the Union have been more precisely\ndemarcated: Part One, Title I, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n(TFEU) divides the competences of the Union into three categories (exclusive, shared\nand supporting) and lists the areas covered by the three categories.\n\n2. Where it applies\n\nThe principle of subsidiarity applies to all the EU institutions and has practical\nsignificance for legislative procedures in particular. The Lisbon Treaty has strengthened\nthe role of both the national parliaments and the Court of Justice in monitoring\ncompliance with the principle of subsidiarity. It not only introduced an explicit reference\nto the subnational dimension of the subsidiarity principle, but also strengthened the\nrole of the Committee of the Regions and made it possible, at the discretion of national\nparliaments, for regional parliaments with legislative powers to be involved in the ex-\nante 'early warning' mechanism.\n\nD. National parliamentary scrutiny\n\nIn keeping with the second subparagraph of Article 5(3) and Article 12(b) TEU, national\nparliaments monitor compliance with the principle of subsidiarity in accordance with\nthe procedure set out in Protocol No 2. Under the ex-ante ‘early warning' procedure\nreferred to above, any national parliament or any chamber of a national parliament\nhas eight weeks from the date of forwarding of a draft legislative act to send to the\nPresidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission a reasoned\nopinion stating why it considers that the draft in question does not comply with the\n\nprinciple of subsidiarity. If reasoned opinions represent at least one-third (one vote per\nchamber for a bicameral parliamentary system and two votes for a unicameral system)\nof the votes allocated to the national parliaments, the draft must be reviewed (‘yellow\ncard'). The institution which produced the draft legislative act may decide to maintain,\namend or withdraw it, giving reasons for that decision. For draft acts relating to the\narea of freedom, security and justice, the threshold is lower (one-quarter of the votes).\nIf, in the context of the ordinary legislative procedure, at least a simple majority of the\nvotes allocated to national parliaments challenge the compliance of a proposal for a\nlegislative act with the principle of subsidiarity and the Commission decides to maintain\nits proposal, the matter is referred to the legislator (European Parliament and Council),\nwhich takes a decision at first reading. If the legislator considers that the legislative\nproposal is not compatible with the principle of subsidiarity, it may reject it subject to\na majority of 55% of the members of the Council or a majority of the votes cast in the\nEuropean Parliament ('orange card').\n\nIn May 2012, the first ‘yellow card' was issued with regard to a Commission proposal\nfor a regulation concerning the exercise of the right to take collective action within\nthe context of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services\n('Monti II'). Twelve out of 40 national parliaments or chambers thereof (19 out of 54\nvotes allocated) considered that the content of the proposal was not consistent with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity. The Commission ultimately withdrew its proposal, though it took\nthe view that the subsidiarity principle had not been infringed. In October 2013, another\n'yellow card' was issued by 14 chambers of national parliaments in 11 Member States\n(18 votes) following the submission of the proposal for a regulation on the establishment\nof the European Public Prosecutor's Office. After examining the reasoned opinions\nreceived from the national parliaments, the Commission decided to maintain the\nproposal, arguing that it was in line with the subsidiarity principle. In May 2016, a third\n'yellow card' was issued by 14 chambers in 11 Member States against the proposal for\na revision of the directive on the posting of workers. The Commission again decided\nto maintain its proposal, given that it did not infringe the principle of subsidiarity, the\nposting of workers being, by definition, a transnational issue.\n\nΕ. Judicial review\n\nCompliance with the principle of subsidiarity may be reviewed retrospectively (following\nthe adoption of the legislative act) by means of a legal action brought before the\nCourt of Justice of the European Union. That is also stated in the protocol. The Union\ninstitutions enjoy wide discretion in applying this principle, however. In its judgments\nin Cases C-84/94 and C-233/94, the Court found that compliance with the principle\nof subsidiarity was one of the conditions covered by the requirement to state the\nreasons for Union acts, under Article 296 TFEU. This requirement is met if it is clear\nfrom reading the recitals that the principle has been complied with. In a more recent\njudgment (Case C-547/14, Philipp Morris, paragraph 218), the Court reaffirmed that\nit must verify ‘whether the Union legislator was entitled to consider, on the basis of a\ndetailed statement, that the objective of the proposed action could be better achieved\nat Union level'.\n\nLegal actions of this kind may be brought by Member States or notified by them on\nbehalf of their national parliament or a chamber thereof, in accordance with their legal\nsystem. The Committee of the Regions may also bring actions of this kind against\n\nlegislative acts if the TFEU provides that it must be consulted on the adoption of such\nacts.\n\n### ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n\nThe European Parliament was the instigator of the concept of subsidiarity and, on\n14 February 1984, in adopting the draft TEU, proposed a provision stipulating that in\ncases where the Treaty conferred on the Union a competence which was concurrent\nwith that of the Member States, the Member States could act as long as the Union had\nnot legislated. Moreover, it stressed that the Community should only act to carry out\nthose tasks which could be undertaken more effectively in common than by individual\nstates acting separately.\n\nParliament was to reiterate these proposals in many resolutions (for example those\nof 23 November and 14 December 1989, 12 July and 21 November 1990 and\n18 May 1995), in which it reaffirmed its support for the principle of subsidiarity.\n\nA. Interinstitutional agreements\n\nOn 25 October 1993, the Council, Parliament and the Commission signed\nan interinstitutional agreement which demonstrated clearly the three institutions'\neagerness to take decisive steps in this area. They thus undertook to comply with the\nprinciple of subsidiarity. The agreement lays down, by means of procedures governing\nthe application of the principle of subsidiarity, arrangements for the exercise of the\npowers conferred on the Union institutions by the Treaties, so that the objectives laid\ndown in the Treaties can be attained. The Commission undertook to take into account\nthe principle of subsidiarity and show that it has been observed. The same applies to\nParliament and the Council, in the context of the powers conferred on them.\n\nThe three institutions agreed to regularly use their internal procedures to check whether\nthe proposed action complies with the principle of subsidiarity as regards both the\nchoice of instruments and the substance of the proposal. Rule 42 of Parliament's Rules\nof Procedure thus states that 'during the examination of a proposal for a legislative act,\nParliament shall pay particular attention to whether that proposal respects the principles\nof subsidiarity and proportionality'. In addition, the Commission produces an annual\nreport on compliance with the subsidiarity principle, on which Parliament usually gives\nits opinion in the form of an own-initiative report drawn up by its Committee on Legal\nAffairs.\n\nUnder the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement on ‘Better Lawmaking' of April 2016\n(replacing the Agreement of December 2003 and the Interinstitutional Common\nApproach to Impact Assessment of November 2005), the Commission must explain\nin its explanatory memoranda how the proposed measures are justified in the light of\nthe principle of subsidiarity and must take this into account in its impact assessments.\nMoreover, in concluding the framework agreement of 20 November 2010 Parliament\nand the Commission undertook to cooperate with the national parliaments in order to\nfacilitate the exercise by those parliaments of their power to scrutinise compliance with\nthe principle of subsidiarity.\n\nB. European Parliament resolutions\n\nIn its resolution of 13 May 1997, Parliament already made clear its view that the principle\nof subsidiarity was a binding legal principle but pointed out that its implementation\nshould not obstruct the exercise by the EU of its exclusive competence, nor be\n\nused as a pretext to call into question the _acquis communautaire_. In its resolution of\n8 April 2003, Parliament added that disputes should preferably be settled at political\nlevel, while taking into account the proposals made by the Convention on the Future of\nEurope concerning the establishment by the national parliaments of an ‘early warning'\nmechanism in the area of subsidiarity. This mechanism was indeed incorporated into\nthe Lisbon Treaty (see above and 1.3.5).\n\nIn its resolution of 13 September 2012, Parliament welcomed the closer involvement\nof the national parliaments in scrutinising legislative proposals in the light of the\nprinciples of subsidiarity and proportionality and suggested that any ways to alleviate\nimpediments to national parliaments' participation in the subsidiarity control mechanism\nshould be investigated. It also suggested that an assessment be made to determine\nwhether appropriate criteria should be laid down at EU level for evaluating compliance\nwith the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\n\nRoberta Panizza\n05/2018\n\n# 3 - SUPRANATIONAL DECISION-\n# MAKING PROCEDURES - [1.2.3.]\n\nThe Member States of the European Union have agreed, as a result of their\nmembership of the EU, to transfer some of their powers to the EU institutions in\nspecified policy areas. Thus, EU institutions make supranational binding decisions\nin their legislative and executive procedures, budgetary procedures, appointment\nprocedures and quasi-constitutional procedures.\n\n### HISTORY (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4 AND 1.1.5)\nThe Treaty of Rome gave the Commission powers of proposal and negotiation, mainly\nin the fields of legislation and external economic relations, and allocated powers for\ndecision-making to the Council or, in the case of appointments, representatives of the\nMember States' governments. It gave Parliament a consultative power. Parliament's\nrole has gradually grown, in the budgetary domain with the reforms of 1970 and 1975,\nin the legislative domain with the Single European Act and all the following Treaties, in\nthe first place the Treaty of Maastricht introducing codecision with the Council, which\nalso increased Parliament's role in appointments. Furthermore, the Single European\nAct gave Parliament the power to authorise ratification of accession and association\ntreaties; Maastricht extended that power to other international treaties of certain kinds.\nThe Treaty of Amsterdam made substantial progress down the road to democratising\nthe Community, by simplifying the codecision procedure, extending it to new areas and\nstrengthening Parliament's role in appointing the Commission. Following this approach,\nthe Treaty of Nice considerably increased Parliament's powers. On the one hand, the\ncodecision procedure (in which Parliament has the same powers as the Council) was\napplied to almost all new areas where the Council was entitled to decide by qualified\nmajority. On the other hand, Parliament acquired the same powers as the Member\nStates in terms of referring matters to the Court of Justice. The Treaty of Lisbon is\na further qualitative step towards full equality with the Council in EU legislation and\nfinance.\n\n### LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES[1]\nA. Ordinary legislative procedure (Article 289 and 294 TFEU)\n1. Scope\n\nThe Lisbon Treaty added 40 further legal bases, in particular in the area of justice,\nfreedom and security and in agriculture, under which the Parliament now decides\non legislative acts on equal footing with the Council. Hence, the ordinary legislative\nprocedure, formerly called the codecision procedure, applies to 85 legal bases. The\nordinary legislative procedure includes qualified majority voting (QMV) in the Council\n(Article 294 TFEU). However, it does not apply to several important areas, for example\nfiscal policy concerning direct taxation or transnational aspects of family law, which\nrequire unanimity in the Council.\n\n2. Procedure\n\nThe ordinary legislative procedure follows the same steps as the former codecision\nprocedure. However, the wording of the TFEU has changed considerably, notably to\nunderline the equal role of Council and Parliament in this procedure.\na. Commission proposal\nb. First reading in Parliament\n\nParliament adopts its position by a simple majority.\nC. First reading in the Council\n\nThe Council adopts its position by QMV.\n\nIn the fields of social security and police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters,\nthe proposal can be submitted to the European Council at the request of one Member\nState (Articles 48 and 82 TFEU), and this suspends the ordinary legislative procedure\nuntil the European Council reassigns the matter to the Council (at the latest after four\nmonths). In the case of Article 82, at least nine Member States may decide to continue\ndeliberations under enhanced cooperation (Article 20 TEU and Article 326-334 TFEU).\n\nIf the Council approves Parliament's position, the act is adopted in the wording which\ncorresponds to Parliament's position.\nd. Second reading in Parliament\n\nParliament receives the Council's position and has three months to take a decision.\nIt may thus:\ne.\n\nApprove the proposal as amended by the Council or take no decision; in both\ncases, the act as amended by the Council is adopted;\n\nReject the Council's position by an absolute majority of its Members; the act is not\nadopted and the procedure ends;\n\nAdopt, by an absolute majority of its Members, amendments to the Council's\nposition, which are then put to the Commission and the Council for their opinion.\nSecond reading in the Council\n\nIf the Council, voting by a qualified majority on Parliament's amendments, and\nunanimously on those on which the Commission has delivered a negative opinion,\napproves all of Parliament's amendments no later than three months after receiving\nthem, the act is adopted.\n\nOtherwise, the Conciliation Committee is convened within six weeks.\nf. Conciliation\n\nThe Conciliation Committee consists of an equal number of Council and Parliament\nrepresentatives, assisted by the Commission. It considers the positions of\nParliament and the Council and has six weeks to agree on a joint text supported by\na QMV of Council representatives and a majority of Parliament's representatives.\n\nThe procedure stops and the act is not adopted if the Committee does not reach\nagreement on a joint text by the deadline.\n\nIf it does so, the joint text is sent to the Council and Parliament for approval.\n\ng. Conclusion of the procedure (third reading)\n\nThe Council and Parliament have six weeks to approve the joint text. The Council\nacts by a qualified majority and Parliament by a majority of the votes cast.\n\nThe act is adopted if the Council and Parliament approve the joint text.\n\nIf either of the institutions has not approved it by the deadline, the procedure stops\nand the act is not adopted.\n\nOver the past few years, the number of first reading agreements based on informal\nnegotiations between the Council and Parliament has significantly increased.\n\nSome bridge clauses allow the European Council to extend the application of the\nordinary procedure to areas exempted from it (for example social policy: Article 153(2)).\n\nB. Consultation procedure\n\nBefore taking a decision, the Council must take note of the opinion of Parliament and,\nif necessary, of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee\nof the Regions. It is required to do so, as the absence of such consultation makes\nthe act illegal and capable of annulment by the Court of Justice (see judgment in\nCases 138 and 139/79). When the Council intends to substantially amend the proposal,\nit is required to consult Parliament again (judgment in Case 65/90).\n\nC. Consent procedure\n1. Scope\n\nAs a result of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the consent procedure applies\nin particular to the horizontal budgetary flexibility clause, as specified in Article 352\nTFEU (former Article 308 TEC). Other examples are action to combat discrimination\n(Article 19(1) TFEU) and membership of the Union (Articles 49 and 50 TEU). In addition,\nParliament's consent is required for association agreements (Article 217 TFEU),\naccession of the Union to the ECHR (Article 6(2) TEU), and agreements establishing\na specific institutional framework entailing major budgetary implications or concerning\nareas where the ordinary legislative procedure applies (Article 218(6) TFEU).\n2. Procedure\n\nParliament considers a draft act forwarded by the Council; it decides whether to approve\nthe draft (it cannot amend it) by an absolute majority of the votes cast. The Treaty\ndoes not give Parliament any formal role in the preceding stages of the procedure to\nconsider the Commission proposal, but as a result of interinstitutional arrangements it\nhas become the practice to involve Parliament informally (see Parliament's Rules of\nProcedure).\n\n### BUDGETARY PROCEDURE (1.2.5)\n### APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES\n\nA. Parliament elects the President of the Commission (Article 14(1) TEU) (1.3.8).\nB. The European Council, acting by qualified majority, appoints the High\nRepresentative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (Article 18(1) TEU).\nC. The Council, acting by qualified majority, adopts:\n\nThe list of the other persons whom it proposes for appointment as Members of the\nCommission, by common accord with the President-elect (Article 17(7) TEU).\n\nD. The Council adopts the list of:\nE.\n\nThe members of the Court of Auditors (Article 286 TFEU), after consulting\nParliament and in accordance with the proposals put forward by the Member\nStates;\n\nMembers and alternate members of the Committee of the Regions and the\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee, drawn up in accordance with the\nproposals made by each Member State (Articles 301, 302 and 305 TFEU).\n\nParliament elects the European Ombudsman (Article 228 TFEU).\n\n### CONCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS\n\nHaving gained legal personality, the Union can now conclude international agreements\n(Article",

Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on\n1 December 2009, the same value was also given to the Charter of Fundamental\nRights.

The power to\nadopt these acts may be delegated to the Commission by the legislator (Parliament and\nthe Council). The objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power\nare defined in the legislative act, as are any urgent procedures, where applicable. In\naddition, the legislator lays down the conditions to which the delegation is subject, which\nmay be the authority to revoke the delegation or the right to express an objection.\n\nImplementing acts are generally adopted by the Commission, which is competent to\ndo so in cases where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding acts are\nneeded. Implementing acts are a matter for the Council only in specific cases which\nare duly justified and in areas of common foreign and security policy. Where a basic\nact is adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Parliament or\nthe Council may at any time indicate to the Commission that, in its view, a draft\nimplementing act goes beyond the implementing powers provided for in the basic act.\nIn this case, the Commission must revise the draft act in question.",

In areas in which the European Union does not have exclusivecompetence, the principle of subsidiarity seeks to safeguard the ability of the MemberStates to take decisions and action and authorises intervention by the Union when theobjectives of an action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but canbe better achieved at Union level, ‘by reason of the scale and effects of the proposedaction'.

Origin and history\nThe principle of subsidiarity was formally enshrined by the Maastricht Treaty, whichincluded a reference to it in the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC).The Single European Act (1987) had already incorporated a subsidiarity criterion intoenvironmental policy, however, albeit without referring to it explicitly as such. In itsjudgment of 21 February 1995 (T-29/92), the Court of First Instance of the EuropeanCommunities ruled that the principle of subsidiarity was not a general principle of law,against which the legality of Community action should have been tested, prior to theentry into force of the TEU.Without changing the wording of the reference to the principle of subsidiarity in therenumbered Article 5, second paragraph, of the EC Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdamannexed to the EC Treaty a ‘Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarityand proportionality'. The overall approach to the application of the principle ofsubsidiarity agreed at the 1992 European Council in Edinburgh thus became legallybinding and subject to judicial review via the protocol on subsidiarity.",

Italso added an explicit reference to the regional and local dimension of the principleof subsidiarity. What is more, the Lisbon Treaty replaced the 1997 protocol on theapplication of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality with a new protocol of the same name (Protocol No 2), the main difference being the new role of the nationalparliaments in ensuring compliance with the principle of subsidiarity (1.3.5).B. DefinitionThe general aim of the principle of subsidiarity is to guarantee a degree ofindependence for a lower authority in relation to a higher body or for a local authorityin relation to central government. It therefore involves the sharing of powers betweenseveral levels of authority, a principle which forms the institutional basis for federalstates.",

The Treaty of Amsterdam made substantial progress down the road to democratising the Community, by simplifying the codecision procedure, extending it to new areas and strengthening Parliament's role in appointing the Commission. Following this approach, the Treaty of Nice considerably increased Parliament's powers. On the one hand, the codecision procedure (in which Parliament has the same powers as the Council) was applied to almost all new areas where the Council was entitled to decide by qualified majority. On the other hand, Parliament acquired the same powers as the Member States in terms of referring matters to the Court of Justice.
