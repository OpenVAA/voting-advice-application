Such a prospect elicits great concern that the 10th European legislature could stymie EU integration and policymaking at a time when geopolitics and permacrisis call for more – rather than less - unity and ambition in the Union's action.\n\nThree main reasons lend credibility to these unsettling forecasts:\n\n1. Radical-right parties continue to make inroads into power at the national level in the member states.\n2. The European electoral arena has generally proven more accessible to them than many national parliaments.\n3. Voters' undiluted and sustained dissatisfaction with mainstream political representatives in today's complex reality can easily translate into a protest vote.\n\nIn addition, poor turnout could also benefit the hardliners. However, even if the participation rate goes up again, like in 2019, and as recent polls suggest, the substance of the election campaigns could still prove auspicious for the far-right. By moving away from the anti-EU mantra and showing readiness to have difficult conversations on divisive subjects, the radicals can appear more attuned, and thus more appealing, to electorates than the mainstream parties. So, Europe might well be heading down a nationalist, protectionist, anti-Islam, and illiberal path in the upcoming EP vote.\n\n> Europe might well be heading down a nationalist, protectionist, anti-Islam, and illiberal path in the upcoming EP vote.",

Focused on the pursuit of a more honest relationship with citizens, radical populists tend to only gesture towards policy when they win elections at the national or EU level. This makes them more eclectic and moralistic than programmatic, and so less dangerous in terms of direct policy influence. While this could change if they score big in the upcoming European elections, for now, data backs received wisdom about their performance.\n\nUsing roll-call voting records collected by Eulytix, this Discussion Paper calculated the average proportion of MEPs who aligned themselves with the winning side in voting sessions across the outgoing Parliament. The results reveal that the members of radical right- wing groups - i.e. the Independents (NI), Identity and Democracy (ID), and European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) – have been much less likely to agree with the outcome of a voting session compared to their centrist or left-wing counterparts.

Such a prospect elicits great concern that the 10th European legislature could stymie EU integration and policymaking at a time when geopolitics and permacrisis call for more – rather than less - unity and ambition in the Union's action.\n\nThree main reasons lend credibility to these unsettling forecasts:\n\n1. Radical-right parties continue to make inroads into power at the national level in the member states.\n2. The European electoral arena has generally proven more accessible to them than many national parliaments.\n3. Voters' undiluted and sustained dissatisfaction with mainstream political representatives in today's complex reality can easily translate into a protest vote.\n\nIn addition, poor turnout could also benefit the hardliners. However, even if the participation rate goes up again, like in 2019, and as recent polls suggest, the substance of the election campaigns could still prove auspicious for the far-right. By moving away from the anti-EU mantra and showing readiness to have difficult conversations on divisive subjects, the radicals can appear more attuned, and thus more appealing, to electorates than the mainstream parties. So, Europe might well be heading down a nationalist, protectionist, anti-Islam, and illiberal path in the upcoming EP vote.\n\n> Europe might well be heading down a nationalist, protectionist, anti-Islam, and illiberal path in the upcoming EP vote.\n\nWhere today's apostles of doom and gloom are likely wrong about is the expected impact of the new 'wave' of radical right populists in the new Parliament. Focused on the pursuit of a more honest relationship with citizens, radical populists tend to only gesture towards policy when they win elections at the national or EU level. This makes them more eclectic and moralistic than programmatic, and so less dangerous in terms of direct policy influence. While this could change if they score big in the upcoming European elections, for now, data backs received wisdom about their performance.\n\nUsing roll-call voting records collected by Eulytix, this Discussion Paper calculated the average proportion of MEPs who aligned themselves with the winning side in voting sessions across the outgoing Parliament. The results reveal that the members of radical right- wing groups - i.e. the Independents (NI), Identity and Democracy (ID), and European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) – have been much less likely to agree with the outcome of a voting session compared to their centrist or left-wing counterparts. Consequently, they emerged as the least influential groups during the present mandate (2019-2024).\n\n> The members of radical right-wing groups emerged as the least influential groups during the present mandate.\n\nIn part, the reason why the rise of far-right parties in the European Parliament has so far not translated into direct policy impact is linked to their inter- and intra- group cohesion problems. Indeed, the analysis in this Paper shows that, apart from the NI, the most incohesive families in the European Parliament are the ID and ECR groups. The NI seems to be the least cohesive, while the Greens/EFA group emerges as the most cohesive group of all.\n\nSimilar results transpire when factions are clustered into coalitions. The coalition consisting of the radical right-wing groups (i.e. ID and ECR) transpires as the least able to determine policy outcomes, while mainstream parties appear best placed to call the shots on decisions. The study also indicates that radical right-wingers would need to win, on average, 72% of the seats in the EP to be able to completely control vote outcomes on their own – a reassuringly unlikely scenario.\n\nFurther exploring the cohesion of the far-right by policy domain reveals significant divisions between radical-right groups on budgetary issues, relations with third countries (for instance, Russia and Ukraine), and employment policy. Conversely, in areas linked to EU institutions, public health, and, most notably, the environment and energy, the radical populist right exhibits greater unity.\n\nJudging by their preferred type of engagement with EP activities, far-right parties seem aware of their lack of real influence on legislation. Data shows that in the outgoing Parliament, the members of the ID and ECR groups wrote a disproportionately large number of questions to the European Commission by reference to their size. In contrast, the number of amendments sponsored by members of the ID group in the EP committees is strikingly low in the latest legislature. But if their ranks swelled after the June European elections, far-right parties could gain confidence to shift from simply seeking publicity to trying to shape policy.\n\n> ID and ECR groups wrote a disproportionately large number of questions to the European Commission.

The results reveal that, on average, merely 827 out of approximately 17,000 investigated voting sessions – i.e. 4.8% of all cases – would turn out differently. The most affected policy area would be environmental policy (328 impacted voting sessions) and the only ordinary legislative procedure that would fail is the Nature Restoration Law. Thus, the direct, negative knock-on effects of more hardliners in the next EP should be minimal.\n\n> The direct, negative knock-on effects of more hardliners in the next EP should be minimal.\n\nThis conclusion can help to steady one's nerves that the situation is not as bleak as it looks. But on the policy areas that emerge as more vulnerable to far-right pressure (including, beyond the environment, EU institutions, social affairs, agriculture, and external relations) – and which, incidentally, coincide with citizens' own list of policy priorities – the centre-right groups, especially the European People's Party (EPP), might feel compelled to move further right. They could do so by adopting the inflammatory vocabulary and restrictive positions of the radicals to recapture electorates. The analysis clearly shows that a potential realignment towards the far-right in a more right-leaning Parliament depends entirely on the political position and tactical direction that the EPP group decides to pursue.\n\n> The mainstream's/EPP's choice is thus stark: turn against democracy through radicalisation or update democracy via reform.\n\nThe mainstream's/EPP's choice is thus stark: turn against democracy through radicalisation or update democracy via reform. The former strategy, which takes the far-right as standard-bearer, would eventually backfire for the copycat parties but would spell particularly bad news for the future of the EU and European democracy. The latter tactic requires a change in how policies and decisions are made to fix the broken democratic relationship between mainstream politicians and voters. This dilemma makes for a dire but not hopeless situation. What is needed is for the political mainstream (above all, the EPP) to live up to the responsibility that comes with its great power in order to forge unity and leadership in the new European Parliament.\n\n***\n\n# Introduction - Forecasting the far-right surge\n\nWith only two months before the June 2024 elections to the European Parliament (EP), political campaigning, lead-candidate nominations, and vote predictions are underway. On the face of it, it is another run-of-the-mill debut for a new round of EP elections. But a steady drumbeat of warnings¹ about a radical-right spectre hunting the very soul of EU democracy suggests that the upcoming European vote is anything but ordinary: nationalistic, radical right-wing lawmakers seem fated to shake the establishment at the ballot box and take over as much as a quarter of the seats in the next European assembly.\n\n> Nationalistic, radical right-wing lawmakers seem fated to shake the establishment at the ballot box and take over as much as a quarter of the seats in the next European assembly.\n\nAll traditional, pro-EU democratic forces in the EP are said to face unprecedentedly gusty winds from the far-right Identity and Democracy group (ID) and the nationalist European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). While electoral support for the two largest mainstream Euro parties - the European People's Party (EPP) and the Party of European Socialists (S&D) – is predicted to remain overall stable, the Greens-EFA group and the liberals Renew Europe (RE) are forecasted to lose up to a third of their current share. Such a prospect elicits great concern that the 10th European legislature could stymie EU integration and policymaking at a time when geopolitics and permacrisis³ call for more – rather than less - unity and ambition in the Union's action.\n\nWill a consolidated block of in-house far-right Eurosceptics wreak havoc in the new Parliament? Will the upcoming European elections prove a \"make or break moment\"4 for the EU and its democracy? This Paper argues that it is quite plausible that the upcoming EP vote will swell the ranks of radical Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and deliver to traditional, centrist parties results that feel too close for comfort. In this scenario, the EP and EU could well go haywire. But before throwing in the towel and succumbing to panic, two critical risk factors warrant scrutiny: the mainstream's, especially EPP's, response and the relevance of specific policy areas.\n\nTo assess the potential impact of a record number of radical right-wing MEPs, this paper uses seat projections by Politico⁵ and roll-call votes data collected by Eulytix⁶ during the current legislature to estimate the number and percentage of voting sessions in the outgoing Parliament, as well as policy areas, in which the outcome would be distinct in a more right-leaning EP.\n\nThe results reveal that, on average, merely 827 out of approximately 17,000 investigated voting sessions – i.e. 4.8% of all cases – would turn out differently. The most affected policy area would be environmental policy (328 impacted voting sessions) and the only ordinary legislative procedure (COD) that would fail is the Nature Restoration Law. Thus, the direct, negative knock-on effects of more hardliners in the next EP should be minimal. This conclusion can help to steady one's nerves that the situation is not as bleak as it looks. But to pass the reality test, it is imperative that the political centre stands its ground on liberal democratic policy, rhetoric, and values.\n\n# 1. Gloomy prospects\n\nThe current forecasts are unsettling but hardly far-fetched. Three reasons lend credibility to the nagging suspicion that the next EP elections are out of joint.⁷ Radical-right parties continue to make inroads into power at the national level in the member states; the European electoral arena has generally proven more accessible to them than many national parliaments; and voters' undiluted and sustained dissatisfaction with mainstream political representatives in today's complex reality can easily translate into a protest vote.\n\n## 1.1. RADICALS MARCH ON IN THE MEMBER STATES\n\nSince at least the 1990s, parties that were once confined to the ideological right and left margins of the political system have steadily increased their presence in the traditional space of politics through electoral success and media coverage in many, including key, member states. Radical right parties taking on ministerial roles in coalition governments is no longer taboo,⁸ as they win on a par with the biggest players in their countries or outright dominate the national electoral arena. Public opinion polls also frequently document their robust popular appeal.¹⁰\n\nIn November 2023, the far-right, anti-Islam Party for Freedom (PVV) came first in the Dutch general elections and in March 2024, the far-right, populist Chega stunned with a solid third place in the snap vote held in Portugal. Moreover, national-conservative, right-wing parties are currently soaring in the polls in countries like Austria (Freedom Party), Belgium (Flemish Interest and New Flemish Alliance) and France (Rassemblement National), promising to shift politics (further) to the right at the next ballot. Thus, past and recent experience suggests that radical populists are not a passing, accidental mood; they manifest a clear and consistent trend to field/ feed elections at all levels. ¹¹\n\n> Radical populists are not a passing, accidental mood; they manifest a clear and consistent trend to field/feed elections at all levels.\n\nThe popularity of such parties is, first and foremost, problematic for the countries in which they thrive, especially if they come in office and start attacking core democratic institutions like the judiciary and the independence of the media (think Hungary under Fidesz, Poland under the Law and Justice, or Italy under Forza Italia). ¹² But their success can also prove a liability for the EU. As part of the government in countries like Hungary, Italy, Finland, and Slovakia, members of far- right parties now sit around the (European) Council table and enjoy direct opportunities to project their nativist and populist platforms with the intention of destabilising patterns of political interaction also on the European tier.\n\nTo be sure, incumbency can prove detrimental for parties in power when they compete in European elections. In the latest, 2019 EP vote, across all member states, populist right forces that were in government (e.g. in Greece, Slovakia, Estonia, and the Czech Republic) lost 3% compared to previous national elections. ¹³ Yet, anti-European populists are likely to be top-ranking this year in a dozen of other member states, where they are currently not in office. ¹⁴ Together with the fact that citizens increasingly perceive radical right parties as convincing political options at any election, they might score big in the upcoming EP vote.\n\nAnd if they do end up tilting the balance of power in the next EP towards the right, the results can reverberate and reinforce similar, existing tendencies in the (European) Council. This development would be consequential for agenda-sending and policymaking across EU institutions. The effect could also spill back to the national level, where mainstream parties in the member states could come under ever more political pressure to refrain (even more) from their EU integration/reform ambitions. Heartened by potentially solid gains, the far-right forces in the next EP could also complicate the approval of the inbound College of Commissioners. ¹⁵\n\n> The effect could also spill back to the national level, where mainstream parties in the member states could come under ever more political pressure to refrain (even more) from their EU integration/ reform ambitions.\n\n## 1.2. EP ELECTIONS BODE WELL FOR RADICALS\n\nOngoing political dynamics in the member states might favour the odds of far-right parties at the EU level. Yet, these parties have tended to fare well in European elections. This is largely explained by the widespread perception that there is ‘little at stake' in the EP vote in terms of policy influence and the allocation of executive power compared to national electoral contests. Hence, the label of Nebenwahlen or \"second-order national elections\"¹⁶ is often used to describe the European elections, where national parties simply rehearse national politics and citizens can switch votes at low risk: i.e. punish the incumbent government or “vote with the heart\"¹⁷ by choosing opposition/small(er) parties, often new and more radical. On average, the number of populist radical right parties in the EP rose by 12.5% in the 2014 elections and consolidated again in 2019, when they won 161 seats - compared to 118 five years earlier.\n\nIf citizens believe that EP elections are lacklustre affairs, ¹⁸ they feel less motivated to vote. This is why turnout is said to have remained consistently lower in the European elections compared to the national ones. ¹⁹ Poor turnout tends to benefit hardliners, who are better than the mainstream at getting voters to go to the ballot box. Successive treaty reforms since the mid-1980s²⁰ might have gradually increased the Parliament's powers and relevance in the EU's institutional architecture. But, judged by participation rates, voters do not seem to have picked up on these upgrades. Turnout has dropped from 62% in 1972 to 42.6% in 2014. Except at the latest elections in 2019, when turnout went up for the first time in over two decades, reaching 50.7%. The higher level of participation in the previous EP vote was arguably a key factor why far-right parties had a poorer electoral showing than expected in 2018/early 2019.\n\nWhere the progressive expansion of EP competences seems to have 'failed', the previous chapters of the ongoing permacrisis (e.g. migration/refugee crisis, Brexit) might have 'succeeded', raising the salience and relevance of 'Europe' in people's lives, and encouraging citizens to vote in greater numbers in the 2019 European elections. Of course, the 2014 EP vote also took place in a crisis-ridden context given the strong lingering effects of the 2009 sovereign debt crisis; and turnout continued to dive at that time. But perhaps the cumulative effect of a decade of poly-crisis²¹ had to first kick in, before people would mobilise to participate in EP elections.\n\nIf so, then all the crises that have seamlessly followed each other since 2019 (including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine), in a world ever more challenged by transformative forces (such as climate change, digitalisation, or ageing and shrinking society), should also help in June to decisively arrest the long-standing trajectory of low turnouts in European elections.\n\nData appear to support this prospect. A Eurobarometer poll from December 2023 reveals that 57% of respondents are interested in the upcoming EP elections (up six points from 2019) and 68% of them intend to vote (nine points more than last time).²² In addition, a Bertelsmann Stiftung Eupinions survey from the same period reports equally high levels of vote intention (i.e. 60%) among respondents polled across the Union.²³\n\nBut even if turnout increases again in 2024, the substance of the EU debates that are now at the heart of national election campaigns matters a great deal for whether higher participation will thwart the electoral success of radical populist forces. Far-right parties (e.g. in France and Italy) no longer run on an EU exit ticket but rather speak about the need to change the Union. This rhetorical adjustment could resonate with public sentiment that stretches beyond radical constituencies into the mainstream electorate.\n\n> By moving away from the anti-EU mantra and by showing readiness to have difficult conversations on divisive subjects, the radicals can appear to cater to popular demand.\n\nAn ECFR survey²⁴ carried out in January this year in 12 member states shows that many citizens – not just far- right voters – have a rather negative appreciation of the EU's handling of recent crises, i.e. the COVID-19 pandemic, financial crisis, and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
