The Foreign Affairs Council (national foreign ministers) is however chaired by the Union's High Representative.[7]Its decisions are made by qualified majority voting in most areas, unanimity in others, or just simple majority for procedural issues. Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new EU law itself.[6]The General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union, also known as Council Secretariat, assists the Council of the European Union, the presidency of the Council of the European Union, the European Council and the president of the European Council.[8] The Secretariat is headed by the secretary-general of the Council of the European Union.[9] The Secretariat is divided into eleven directorates-general, each administered by a director-general.[10]",
