  "content": "BRIEFING\nEPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service\nAuthors: David de Groot; Silvia Kotanidis\nMembers' Research Service\nPE 757.649 – February 2024 EN\nEuropean elections 2024\nRules of a pan-European democratic event\nSUMMARY\nIn June 2024, around 400 million EU citizens go to the polls to elect the Members of the European\nParliament's 10th legislature. As the only EU institution that represents EU citizens, elections to the\nEuropean Parliament are therefore major democratic events, and the only one at EU level that\nresembles national democratic electoral consultation. European elections, however, differ from the\nnational version, as they are part of a context of multi-tier government, sometimes perceived as\n'second order elections'.\nThe main difference is that the European elections are a rather fragmented exercise, since a great\npart of the electoral process, including the way in which the right to vote is exercised, remains\nsubject to national rules. In addition, the lack of a real transnational forum in which to debate\nEuropean (as opposed to national) issues during European elections is one reason why European\nelections have failed to earn attention comparable to national elections, despite the prominent role\nthe European Parliament has acquired in European policy-making in recent decades.\nA number of reforms have been put forward over the years. Measures to harmonise rules or\nmechanisms that would personalise the elections and hence bring more visibility to the candidates\nand their campaigns have been proposed. Two reforms are pending. In one case, to harmonise a\nfew aspects of the electoral process. In the other, to make additional deeper reforms with the\nintroduction of a Union-wide constituency. A repeat of the lead candidate process (a political rather\nthan a legal practice), is also likely to be attempted for the 2024 elections.\nThis briefing explores the legal framework of the EU electoral rules, highlighting which aspects are\ngoverned by national rules, and describes the innovations the reforms currently on the table could\nbring. It also analyses decisions on the composition of Parliament and initiatives to strengthen the\nresilience of the electoral process.\nIN THIS BRIEFING\n Introduction\n How we currently vote in European\nelections\n Composition of Parliament\n Pending reform of the 1976 European\nElectoral Act\n Strengthening European elections\n What do European citizens think\nabout European elections?\nEPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service\n2\nIntroduction\nEuropean elections are a major democratic event, potentially bringing around 400 million citizens\nto the ballot box. Although the European Parliament has vastly increased its powers since the\ncreation of the European Economic Community (today's European Union), European elections have\nperiodically been an object of reflection and labelled as 'second order elections', despite the\nenthusiasm of EU supporters. European elections select the Members of the European Parliament\nwho, working in political groups and committees, will discuss and amend legislation proposed by\nthe European Commission. In policy areas that now comprise the great majority of EU competences,\nParliament acts as co-legislator with the Council. In some instances, Parliament will even propose\nlegislation in areas of its own competence. The elections to the European Parliament are therefore\na vital element of European democratic architecture, and the only fully democratic event in panEuropean politics.\nThis briefing explores the main aspects governing the electoral rules applicable to European\nelections, highlighting not only their content and historical background, but also how national rules\napply to some of them.\nHow we currently vote in European elections\nStatus of current electoral rules\nToday, EU election rules are a combination of EU and national rules. Notwithstanding the reforms\nattempted or implemented since the first election of Members of Parliament by direct universal\nsuffrage in 1979,\n1 moves to govern EU elections under harmonised rules failed (i.e. the same set\nof rules do not apply in all Member States).\nArticle 223 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) gives the European\nParliament the power to propose rules on the election of its Members, through proposing either a\nuniform procedure or a set of rules that reflect principles common to all Member States. While the\nuniformity of rules has not been achieved so far, the main legislative act that regulates the rules\napplicable to European elections, the 1976 Electoral Act (as amended), merely provides a set of\nprinciples, leaving some leeway to regulate aspects of the European elections according to national\nlaw.\nThe 1976 Electoral Act, as amended by Council Decision 2002/772/EC, consists of 16 articles,\nestablishing some of the main features of the European elections. In particular, the 1976 Electoral\nAct (as amended), provides that the current principles applicable to European elections are the\nfollowing:\n obligation to elect representatives of the European Parliament on the basis of a\nproportional voting system, either a list or a transferable vote system. Member States\nare however free to determine the procedure where a preferential list is used\n(Article 1);\n obligation to institute elections that are held by direct universal suffrage, free and\nsecret (Article 1(3));\n freedom to establish constituencies or to decide on the subdivision of the electoral\narea, provided the proportional nature of the voting system is preserved (Article 2);\n freedom to set thresholds not higher than 5 % (Article 3);\n freedom for Member States to set a ceiling for candidates' electoral expenses\n(Article 4);\n determination of the beginning of a Member's term of office, which is set at five years,\nat the opening of the first session following each election (Article 5);\n Member's mandate to be individual, personal and not subject to instructions, and be\ncovered by the 19\n\nt\n3\n a set of incompatibilities is established with the office of Member of Parliament, such\nas being a: member of government, Commissioner, Judge, Advocate General or\nRegistrar of the Court of Justice of the EU or Court of First Instance, Ombudsman; or a\nmember of some institutions, e.g. the Central Bank, Court of Auditors, Economic and\nSocial Committee or Committee of the Regions; or being a member of bodies tasked\nwith managing EU funds or exercising direct administrative tasks; being member of\nthe board of directors, management committee or staff of the European Investment\nBank; being an active official or servant of the EU institutions, other specialised bodies\nor the European Central Bank. Since 2004, the mandate of Member of the European\nParliament is incompatible with that of member of a national parliament (Article 7).\nThe incompatibilities set in the 1976 Electoral Act are a de minimis requirement, as\nnational legislation may identify further sources of incompatibility;\n Article 8 of the 1976 European Electoral Act lays down a crucial provision which leaves\nto national legislation those parts of the electoral procedure that are not covered by\nthe Electoral Act, provided the proportional nature of the voting system is not\naffected;\n while scheduling 'election day' remains within the power of Member States, the\nelections must take place in the EU within a specific 'electoral period', which is the\nsame for all Member States, starting on a Thursday and ending on a Sunday. The\nresults may not be made publicly available until the polls have closed in the last\nMember State to vote (Articles 10 and 11);\n the power to determine the first 'electoral period' lay with the Council, acting\nunanimously, after consulting Parliament. Subsequent elections must then take place\nin the corresponding period at the end of each five-year term. However, if this is not\npossible, the Council, after consulting Parliament, may determine another electoral\nperiod. This cannot be earlier than two months or later than one month after the\n'electoral period' that would have been applicable at the end of the five-year mandate.\nParliament meets, without the need to be convened, on the first Tuesday following\none month after the end of the 'electoral period'. Until then, the outgoing Parliament\nremains in office (Article 11);\n The new Parliament is responsible for verifying the credentials of new Members\n(Article 12), and in doing so, relies on the results declared by Member States.\nParliament also rules on any dispute arising from the application of the 1976 Electoral\nAct, other than those disputes arising from national provisions to which the Electoral\nAct refers;\n seats may become vacant due to death, resignation or withdrawal of the mandate of\na Member. In this case, Member States must lay down the rules and procedures to fill\nvacant seats for the remaining period of the term of office. If the law of a Member\nState provides for withdrawal of the mandate, national authorities must duly inform\nParliament, while if the mandate ends because of death or resignation, the European\nParliament must duly inform national authorities (Article 13);\n the Council has the power to adopt the Electoral Act'simplementing measures, acting\nunanimously upon a proposal from Parliament after consultation with the European\nCommission, if agreement is not reached, a conciliation committee comprising\nrepresentatives of Council and Parliament should deal with the matter (Article 14).\nThat Member States have the freedom to decide many aspects of the electoral process may on the\none hand affect the electoral procedure, but also the equal treatment of EU citizens on the other\nhand. This may create discrepancies as to the attribution of the right to vote and the exercise of the\nright to vote, i.e. how EU citizens express their vote in different Member States.\nFor example, different rules governing the minimum age for active or passive voting apply in\ndifferent EU Member States. While the overwhelming majority of Member States allow voting at\n18 years, four Member States (Belgium, Germany, Malta and Austria), have lowered the minimum \nEPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service\n4\nvoting age to 16 years, and Greece to 17 years. Likewise, differences exist as to the minimum age to\nstand as a candidate in the EU, with the majority of Member States requiring 18 years, and some 21\n(Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia). In Romania, the\nage to stand as candidate is 23 years, and in Italy and Greece, 25 years. Similarly, other aspects of the\nelectoral process are left to the discretion of the Member States, such as the applicable electoral\nthresholds (5 %, 4 %, 3 % or 1.8 %); or the length of the electoral campaign and electoral silence. In\nthis latter respect, some Member States have no specific rules on the length of the election\ncampaign period, while others may allow 12 days (Portugal), 120 (Latvia), 4 months (Belgium) or\neven 6 months – the longest in the EU (Lithuania). Periods of electoralsilence, during which electoral\ncanvassing may be prohibited, also cover a range of possibilities. In 12 Member States there appear\nto be no specific rules introducing a period of silence prior to elections. In the Member States that\ndo impose a period of silence, this may include the 24 hours prior to election day and the day itself.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule in Lithuania and France, where the silence period is\nshorter than this general rule, or Slovakia, where it is longer. Beyond the length of the silence period,\nMember States also differ as to the activities allowed during the period of silence, with the majority\nof those Member States imposing a period of silence prior to the elections also prohibiting the\npublication of opinion polls. In some Member States such prohibition applies for a longer period\nprior to election day (15 days in Italy, 7 days in Cyprus and 5 days in Spain).\nDivergence in the exercise of the right to vote is also visible in the obligatory or voluntary nature of\nthe act of voting, which differs between EU Member States. Voting is obligatory in Belgium, Bulgaria,\nGreece and Luxembourg. The impact of such divergence on voter's rights is particularly evident in\nthe modalities of casting a vote for EU citizens residing abroad. In some Member States (Czechia,\nIreland, Malta and Slovakia, for example) it is not possible to vote from abroad, while in others only\nvoting by post is possible (Germany, Luxembourg and Austria). Some allow voting by post or at an\nembassy or consulate (Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovenia, Finland and Sweden). A\nconspicuous group of Member States offer citizens resident abroad the possibility to vote only at an\nembassy or consulate (Denmark, Greece, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal, Romania). In Italy and\nBulgaria, this possibility exists only if the residence abroad is in another Member State – it is not\npossible to vote at an embassy or consulate if the citizen resides in a third country. Both France and\nthe Netherlands offer the possibility to cast a vote by proxy, but France additionally allows voting at\nan embassy or consulate, and the Netherlands allows postal votes. Belgium and Estonia both\nprovide either postal voting or voting at an embassy or consulate. In addition, Belgium also allows\na proxy vote, while Estonia provides an e-vote. Further differences exist in the exercise of the right\nto vote in particular circumstances and status, i.e. for disabled people or people in detention. This\nvariety shows how national divergences create a true difference in treatment between EU citizens.\nFinally, disenfranchisement is also subject to national rules. However, the European Court of Human\naffirmed in itsjudgment in Schindler v United Kingdom, that there is no legal obligation to grant nonresident nationals unrestricted access to voting rights.\nA further element, although not enshrined in either national or European electoral rules, is the lead\ncandidate or Spitzenkandidaten process. This practice ran in the past two rounds of European\nelections, with differing outcomes. The lead candidate process establishes a political link between\nthe European elections and the nomination of the President of the Commission. Ahead of the\nelections, European political parties indicate their candidate for the position of President of the\nEuropean Commission. The candidate of the party gaining most seats should then be designated\nby the European Council and thereafter voted by the Parliament. The main aim of this process is to\nbring the choice of the head of the EU's executive closer to citizens. Voting for a European party\nwhose lead candidate is known in advance and who campaigns on that ticket, offers citizens the\npossibility to consciously influence the choice of the holder of this top EU position. This process was\nrun with positive results in 2014, leading to the election of Jean-Claude Junker (the EPP lead\ncandidate) as President of the Commission. However, the process failed in 2019, as none of the lead\ncandidates obtained that position – which went instead to 'outsider' Ursula von der Leyen. \nEuropean elections 2024: Rules of a pan-European democratic event The lead candidate process2 is based on a reading of Article 17(7) TEU which emphasises the political\nconnection between European elections and the nomination of the President of the EU's executive.\nThe process is intended asinnovative, although hotly debated in terms of interinstitutional relations,\nas the European Council has always claimed full ownership of the power to propose the candidate\nfor the Commission presidency according to Article 17(7) TEU. This constitutional innovation was\nintended to make the process of nomination more transparent, fair and not subject to the 'horse\ntrading' approach often present within European Council interactions. It aimed at making the\nprocess leading to the election of the Commission President more comprehensible to EU citizens,\nthereby increasing turnout, by injecting drama and personalisation in the process. Finally, it was\nmeant as a first step towards the creation of a European demos.\nAt the time of writing, the European political parties have not yet all nominated their lead\ncandidates. The European Greens voted for Terry Reintke and Bas Eickhout as their lead candidates\nat an extraordinary extended congress on 2-4 February 2024. The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats\nfor Europe selection procedure should culminate with formal election of a lead candidate in\nMarch 2024. The Party of European Socialists candidate will be announced at the Rome Congress on\n2 March 2024. The European Left launched itsselection process as early as June 2023. The European\nPeople's Party is due to decide on its lead candidate at the Bucharest party congress on\n6-7 March 2024. The Identity and Democracy and European Conservatives and Reformists are\nopposed to the lead candidate process and are unlikely to select any lead candidate.\nIn a resolution of 12 December 2023, Parliament returned to the issue of running the lead candidate\nprocess with a more nuanced approach, calling for the formalisation of the lead candidate process\nin an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the European Council. Parliament\nproposed that the lead candidate from the European political party that obtained the most seats\nshould lead the negotiation for a common Parliament candidate with the largest majority,\nfollowed by the other lead candidates if needed. The Parliament's President should be ready to steer\nthe process, and would have the prerogative to communicate the common Parliament candidate to\nthe European Council. However, should Parliament fail to agree on a common candidate, the\nEuropean Council should engage in negotiations with the President, the lead candidates, the\npresidents of the European political parties and their groups, in advance of the formalisation of a\nproposal from the European Council to the European Parliament. For this purpose, the European\nCouncil should refrain from making a proposal until Parliament presents a common candidate, in\naccordance with the consultations provided for under Article 17(7) TEU. This marks a departure from\nthe 2013 resolution, which indicated that 'the candidate for Commission President put forward by\nthe European political party that wins the most seats in the Parliament will be the first to be\nconsidered, with a view to ascertaining his or her ability to secure the support of the necessary\nabsolute majority in Parliament'.\nRules on mobile EU citizen voters\nIn accordance with Article 22(2) TFEU, Directive 93/109/EC ('the directive') lays down detailed\narrangements for the exercise of the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the\nEuropean Parliament for citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not\nnationals.\nAccording to the Treaties, EU citizens who reside in a Member State other than that of their\nnationality ('mobile EU citizens'), have the right to vote in European Parliament elections in their\nMember State of residence (Articles 20(2)(b) and 22(2) TFEU and Article 39(1) Charter of\nFundamental Rights). Many Member States also provide an alternative option to vote in the Member\nState of their nationality, as detailed above. In such cases, the mobile EU citizens must choose in\nwhich Member State to vote, as double voting is prohibited (Article 4 of the directive). To avoid\ndouble voting, the Member State of residence and the Member State of nationality exchange lists\nof registered voters (Article 13 of the directive). \nEPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service\n6\nTo be eligible to vote in a Member State of residence, mobile EU citizens must ask to be registered\non the electoral roll (Articles 8(1) and 9 of the directive). If voting is compulsory in a Member State,\nthis obligation also applies to mobile EU citizens once they register in that country (Article 8(2) of\nthe directive).\nIf mobile citizens opt to vote in their country of residence, the directive grants them the right to\nparticipate in the elections under the same conditions as nationals of that country, as long as their\nvoting and candidacy rights are not restricted in their home and residence country (Articles 3, 6 and\n7 of the directive) .\nIn the 2024 elections, these rules affect approximately 11 million EU citizens.\nSome Member States do not allow their nationals to vote when residing abroad or apply certain\nconditions. These differences may touch upon voting eligibility or registration requirements, voting\nmethods, or the type of elections, as stated above.\nThe directive also allows a special derogation if more than 20 % of the total eligible EU voters are\nmobile EU citizens (Article 14). This is currently only the case in Luxembourg (41.88 %). Whereas\nbefore 2013, Luxembourg restricted voting rights, requiring mobile citizens to have resided for five\nof the previous six years in Luxembourg, the restrictions now only apply to candidates. More than\nhalf of the list of candidates for each party (four out of six) must be Luxembourg nationals. The\nCommission granted this derogation for the 2024 elections on 11 November 2023.\nIn the 2019 election, turnout among mobile EU citizens was lower than that of nationals of the\ncountry they lived in, and also usually in their countries of origin. Four times as many registered to\nvote for lists from their country of nationality, where that option was available (approximately\n5.5 million compared to 1.3 million, out of a total of 14 million eligible voters at the time).\nThe European Parliament and Commission have set up a dedicated website to encourage mobile\nEU citizens to register and vote in the 2024 European Parliament elections, raising awareness about\nregistration deadlines and procedures in the home and residence countries.\nOn 25 November 2021, the European Commission submitted a proposal to modify\nDirective 93/109/EC. The proposal would change information requirements, introduce a\nstandardised declaration, and provide equal treatment with nationals in different voting methods\nsuch as advance voting, postal voting, and electronic and internet voting. While Parliament adopted\nits opinion on the proposal in February 2023, the Council has yet to reach agreement.\nComposition of Parliament\nThe allocation of seats in the European Parliament among Member States is a traditionally political\nissue, which the Treaties (in particular Article 14 TEU) regulate in a rather general manner. According\nto this provision, the European Parliament has the initial power to propose its own composition,\nwhich is then subject to the European Council's unanimous decision following Parliament's consent.\nArticle 14 TEU establishes three main principles governing the composition of Parliament:\ni. the total number of Members may not exceed 750, plus the President;\nii. the allocation per Member State must follow the principle of degressive\nproportionality;\niii. the allocation may not be less than 6 seats and not more than 96 seats per Member\nState.\nNotwithstanding these general principles, the allocation of seats remains subject to delicate\nnegotiations, since the Treaties do not provide an automatic allocation key and the population of\nMember States varies over time.\nThe most recent allocation of seats, which will be applied in the European elections in June 2024, is\nthe result of proposals and negotiations that took place between June and September 2023 As provided for in Article 14 TEU, the European Parliament began the process by adopting a\nlegislative resolution on 15 June 2023, proposing 11 additional seats, to be allocated to 9 Member\nStates. Parliament proposed to allocate 1 additional seat each to Denmark, Ireland, Latvia, Austria,\nSlovenia, Slovakia and Finland; and 2 additional seats each to Spain and the Netherlands.\nParliament's resolution was based on a report from its Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO)\n(2021/2229 (INL)), adopted days before the vote in plenary, testifying to the urgency of the\nprocedure, as seat allocation needed to be established in good time before the 2024 elections. As\nsuggested by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, it is good practice that the electoral\nsystem, membership of electoral commissions and the drawing of constituency boundaries are not\nmodified later than one year prior to elections.\nAccording to Article 14(2) TEU and by written procedure (Article 7, EUCO Rules of Procedure), on\n22 September 2023, the European Council unanimously adopted the new composition of\nParliament, which in addition to the seats proposed by Parliament, awards 4 additional seats to be\nshared between Belgium (1), Poland (1) and France (2).\nIn conclusion, the European Council decided to add 15 seats to the\ncurrent Parliament:\n 1 each to Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Latvia, Austria, Poland,\nSlovenia, Slovakia and Finland;\n 2 each to Spain, France and the Netherlands;\n No Member State loses any seats.\nAs a result, the composition of Parliament for the 2024-2029 legislature\nwill total 720 seats. Parliament gave its consent to the European Council\ndraft decision, as required by Article 14(2) TEU, on 13 September 2023. In\nthe Explanatory Statement on the draft legislative resolution laying down\nParliament's consent, Parliament regretted that it was not informed of the\nEuropean Council's modification of its original proposal to add a number\nof seats. Parliament also regretted the deletion of the reference to the\n28 seats to be allocated to a Union-wide constituency (subject to the\nadoption of the pending reform).\nIn addition, recital 5 of the draft European Council decision contained a\nstatement to the effect that the budgetary authority and the Commission,\nin the exercise of their prerogatives under the annual budgetary\nprocedure, should ensure that the increase in seats would be budget\nneutral. In giving its consent to the draft European Council decision,\nParliament included an annex, which stated that such decision is 'without\nprejudice to the prerogatives of the European Parliament and the Council\nin the annual budgetary procedure and [that] recital 5 of that draft\ndecision concerns matters that do not fall within the scope of the\nEuropean Council's competences under Article 15(1) TEU and the legal\nbasis of Article 14(2) TEU. It is for the European Parliament and the Council alone to decide on the\ncontent of the Union's budget in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 314 TFEU.'\nThe new composition of Parliament is now set out in European Council Decision (EU) 2023/2061 of\n22 September 2023.\nThe allocation of Parliament's seats has also been modified in the past due to demographic change\nin the Member States, inter alia. For this purpose, the Commission (Eurostat) calculates the total\npopulation of the EU countries on the basis of the most recent data provided by the Member States.\nThe past two modifications are contained in European Council Decisions, of 28 June 2013\n(2013/312/EU) for the 2014-2019 legislative term and more recently in the 28 June 2018 decision\n(2018/937/EU) for the 2019-2024 legislative term. This latter decision provided that, should the United Kingdom withdraw from the EU, 27 (of the 73) seats left vacant would be redistributed\namong 14 Member States. This composition of Parliament for the 2019-2024 legislative term was\nthe result of the subtraction of the 73 UK seats and the simultaneous reallocation of 27 seats, to\ncorrect the allocation which at the time did not comply with the degressive proportionality principle\nenshrined in Article 14(2) TEU for some Member States. As a result, the final Parliament composition\nfor the 2019-2024 legislative term was 705 seats.\nParliament often discusses the allocation of seats among EU Member States. In January 2017, during\nthe 8th legislative term (2014-2019), the AFCO committee hosted a discussion with experts to\nexamine the possibility of a permanent allocation key based on a mathematical formula. The key\nfindings of the three studies presented proposed, inter alia, the adoption of the 'Cambridge\nCompromise' and/or the 'Jagellonian Compromise'. Although prima facie interesting, these and\nfurther options remain to be explored. No further proposals have followed. In general, a permanent\nallocation key would be more objective and transparent, however, as the AFCO explanatory\nstatement notes, Parliament has warned that a permanent seat allocation mechanism would require\nthe revision of the Council voting system to ensure institutional balance.\nParliament is dealing with the sensitive issue of a permanent system of distribution of Parliament\nseats in an autonomous legislative procedure (2023/2104 (INL)).\nWhile the Conference on the Future of Europe, a major exercise of participatory democracy (2021 to\n2022), did not deal with the issue of Parliament's composition among its institutional proposals,\nParliament's extensive follow-up proposals made in September 2023 included that it should gain\nexclusive competence on its composition. This should be decided by the majority of component\nMembers, subject to Council's consent by reinforced majority (point 10 and amendment 23 of\nParliament's resolution).\nPending reform of the 1976 European Electoral Act\nOver the years, several attempts have been made to reform the 1976 European Electoral Act.\nHowever, only Council Decision 2002/772/EC has entered into force, introducing rules such as the\nobligation to have a proportional voting system; freedom for Member States to establish\nconstituencies or to subdivide the electoral area, provided for the proportionality of the voting\nsystem is preserved; the option for Member States to introduce a threshold not higher than 5 %, and\na ceiling for candidates' electoral expenses. One crucial innovation in the 2002 reform was the\nintroduction of incompatibility between the office of Member of the European Parliament and that\nof member of a national parliament. However the 2002 reform did not contain a legal basis for the\ncreation of a Union-wide constituency, proposed in the Anastassoppoulos report (1998, see\nOJ C 292 of 21 September 1998, p. 66), i.e. the basis of Parliament's proposal that led to Council\nDecision 2002/772/EC.\nFurther reform of the 1976 Electoral Act has since been attempted, but without success. However,\nin 2018 a reform was adopted with Council Decision (EU) 2018/994 introducing a number of\nimprovements to the EU electoral system. This reform originated in the AFCO 'Hübner-Leinen'\nreport, defining Parliament's proposal and adopted by Parliament in November 2015. Almost two\nand a half years after Parliament's proposal, Council unanimously adopted the reform on\n7 June 2018. Council Decision 2018/994 contains a number of specific modifications to the 1976\nElectoral Act. While introducing a threshold at national level remains possible, the 2018 Council\nDecision introduces an obligation where the list system is used, to set a threshold no lower than 2 %\nand not higher than 5 % in constituencies electing more than 35 seats. Some aspects of the electoral\ncalendar are also regulated, i.e. where there is a national deadline for the submission of candidacies,\nthe deadline should be at least three weeks before the election day in that Member State. Council\nDecision 2018/994/EC attempts to make European elections more 'European' by giving Member\nStates the option to allow candidates or national parties to display the logo of the European political\nparty to which they are affiliated. Council Decision 2018/994/EC attempts a further approximation \nEuropean elections 2024: Rules of a pan-European democratic event\n9\nof national voting procedures, but still leaves some leeway to Member States by giving Member\nStates the possibility (not the obligation) to allow citizens to vote from a third country or to vote in\nadvance through postal or electronic voting, providing data protection and secrecy of the ballot are\nensured. Council Decision 2018/994/EC does not refer to the lead candidate process as contained in\nParliament's proposal, which would have made it compulsory for European political parties to\nnominate their lead candidate (see proposed Article 3f of Parliament's proposal). Likewise,\nParliament's proposed reference to a Union-wide constituency was not retained in the final text\nadopted by Council (see proposed Article 2a).\nWhile not comprehensive and rather limited to specific aspects of the electoral process, the reform\nadopted under Council Decision 2018/994/EC requires 'ratification' or, as Article 223(1) TFEU\nmandates, Member State approval 'in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements'\na circumstance that has not materialised to date.\nOn the contrary, Parliament adopted a more comprehensive proposal for reform on 3 May 2022.\nParliament proposed a draft legislative act to replace the 1976 Electoral Act, aiming at in-depth\nreform of the European electoral system. Some current aspects of European elections would remain\nunchanged – elections based on a direct universal suffrage, the possibility for Member States to\nestablish either a single or several constituencies, for example. However, the proportional character\nof the electoral system would be preserved, with Member States able to choose between a single\ntransferrable vote, or the list system, or any formula (d'Hondt system or other) for the allocation of\nseats. In other respects, the proposed reform introduces many new elements. The draft legislative\nproposal addresses two main streams, seeking on the one hand to harmonise the exercise of the\nright to vote and on the other to introduce a Union-wide constituency with its own characteristics\nand rules.\nAs to the harmonisation of the electoral rules applying to national constituencies(i.e. not the Unionwide constituency), the draft legislative act proposes, for example, to set the minimum common\nvoting age at 16, except for those Member States whose constitutional order provides for 17 or\n18 years (Article 4). It would oblige Member States to ensure the exercise of the right to vote for\ncitizens residing in third countries and for those without a permanent residence, in closed residential\nsettings or in detention (Article 6). Member States would be obliged to allow postal, advance, proxy,\nelectronic, and internet voting (Article 8). The minimum age to stand as a candidate would be\nharmonised at 18 years in all Member States (Article 5). Furthermore, the draft legislative act\nproposes to introduce an obligation for all political parties and other entities entitled to participate\nin elections to observe democratic procedures and transparency in the election of candidates and\nensure gender balance using a zipped system or a quota. A standard electoral campaign duration\nof eight weeks before 'election day' is proposed (Article 17), with an electoral silence period of\n48 hours. Member States would have to finalise the electoral roll 14 weeks prior to 'election day'\n(Article 9). The draft legislative act proposes to hold the European elections on 9 May every five years\nin all Member States. The proposal also introduces a mandatory threshold for those constituencies\nelecting more than 60 seats, of no less than 3.5 % and no more than 5 %. This provision is rather\nlooser than that set in Council Decision 2018/994/EC. The option for Member States to introduce an\nelectoral threshold of no more than 5 %, regardless of seats in the constituency, would remain.\nThe draft legislative act proposes that 28 seats would be elected in a Union-wide constituency,\nunder a uniform electoral system. As a consequence, voters would cast two ballots: one for their\nnational constituency, one for the Union-wide constituency. Closed lists would apply to the Unionwide constituency, with no electoral threshold, but democratic and transparent procedures for the\nelection of candidates and to ensure gender equality would be required. In addition, precise\narrangements would be introduced in the Union-wide constituency to avert the risk that candidates\nin that constituency originate from the most populous Member States. For that purpose, Annex 1 of\nthe proposal divides all EU Member States into three categories depending on the size of their\npopulation: Group A (more than 37.9 million inhabitants), Group B (between 6.9 and 19.3 million\ninhabitants) and Group C (up to 5.8 million inhabitants). Electoral lists would also be divided into sections containing three slots. In each section, alternate candidates would come from Group A, B\nand C countries. This expedient seeks to avoid the biggest Member States monopolising the leading\npositions. This works in combination with closed electoral lists for the Union-wide constituency, with\nno possibility to express a preference. There is therefore no possibility to alter the order of\ncandidates.\nThe proposal also extends to European political parties, European voter associations, European\nelectoral coalitions and European coalitions of national parties, and/or associations of voters\nproviding the right to submit candidacies. It introduces an independent European electoral\nauthority, comprising 27 members in charge of coordinating the exchange of information with\nnational authorities and monitoring the implementation of the new rules. This authority would be\nin charge of the formation of the electoral roll for the Union-wide constituency, based on national\nrolls, and of proclaiming the list of candidates 11 weeks before the vote, and the electoral results,\nand deciding on any dispute arising from the implementation of the national provisions governing\nEuropean elections.\nThe draft legislative act containing the proposed reform was submitted to the Council. According\nto Article 223 TEFU, the Council would need to agree unanimously for the proposal to be adopted.\nHowever, the discussions in Council demonstrate considerable difficulty in reaching unanimity.\nMajor concerns include the introduction of a Union-wide constituency, the lead candidate process,\n16 year voting age, and the obligation to provide postal voting. Transnational lists and a Union-wide\nconstituency, despite their innovative character, have been proposed several times without success.\nStrengthening European elections\nAs part of its defence of democracy package, the Commission issued a communication on inclusive\nand resilient electoral processes in the Union and enhancing the European nature and efficient\nconduct of the elections to the European Parliament on 12 December 2023.\nThis communication is addressed to Member States and recommends a number of measures to\nfacilitate participation and hence increase turnout. These include facilitating voter registration,\nadequately informing citizens of alternative voting methods (postal, for mobile citizens, advance or\ne-voting). It also recommends Member States ensure gender equality and the participation of\npersons with disabilities, both as voters and candidates. Political parties and campaign\norganisations are encouraged to adopt pledges and codes of conduct that forbid the use of falsified\ndata or manipulative behaviour, for example. European and national political parties should provide\ninformation on amounts spent on political advertising. The communication particularly focuses on\nthe resilience of the electoral environment, including election-related infrastructure, and electionrelated information. It recommends updating risk assessments to test preparedness against cyberattack and other forms of hybrid disruptive action.\nThe Commission recommends the European Cooperation Network on Elections for exchange of\nbest practices. Where necessary, the Commission recommends targeted messages on de-bunking\nand 'pre-bunking' of information to preserve the information environment – whilst respecting the\nfreedom of expression and other fundamental rights and values. The Commission encourages\nMember States to address loopholes in their legislation on donations from foreign countries to\nnational parties and foundations or political candidates, to minimise the risk of foreign interference\nby promoting transparency and limiting permitted donations. Political parties and affiliates should\nassess the risks deriving from donations potentially linked to criminal activity, corruption or other\nforms of crime. The Commission communication encourages Member States to raise awareness of\nthe elections, promote events and information campaigns and exchanges with citizens on EUrelated topics. This should including raising awareness and informing mobile EU citizens who either\nreside in a different Member State to their home state or in a third country, of their electoral rights.\nHowever, it also proposes a number of measures to avoid double votes. \nEuropean elections 2024: Rules of a pan-European democratic event\n11\nTo enhance the European character of elections, the communication recommends making the\naffiliation of a national party with European parties visible not only on the ballot paper but also prior\nto the elections. Finally, besides encouraging cooperation between national election networks, the\nrecommendation places valuable trust in the European Cooperation Network on Elections and the\nRapid Alert System, the latter being particularly relevant to foreign information manipulation and\ninterference. Six months after the 2024 elections, Member States should provide information on the\nconduct of the European Parliament elections to the Commission, including information on how\nthey implemented the Commission recommendation.\nWhat do European citizens think about European elections?\nAccording to the Autumn 2023 Eurobarometer survey, the majority of Europeans (57 %) are\ninterested in the upcoming European elections. In autumn 2018, interest in the 2019 European\nelections was at 51 %.\nSome 68 % of the respondents say they would be likely to vote if European elections were held in a\nweek's time – nine points higher than in autumn 2018, i.e. six months before the 2019 European\nelections. Likelihood to vote in the upcoming elections is higher amongst those who recall having\nrecently heard, read, or seen something about the European Parliament (75 %, against 53 % of those\nwho do not recall seeing the European Parliament in the media). However, knowledge of the 2024 European election dates – 6 to 9 June 2024 – is not yet widespread,\naccording to the Autumn 2023 Eurobarometer survey: 28 % of respondents know the month and\nyear, and 21 % know the correct year, but not the correct month."
