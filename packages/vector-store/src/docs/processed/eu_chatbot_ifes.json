  "content": "This document from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) provides a comprehensive overview of the European Parliament elections held from June 6 to 9, 2024. These elections are a pivotal democratic exercise for the European Union, allowing approximately 358.9 million eligible voters across 27 member states to elect 720 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), an increase of 15 seats from the previous election. The elections are particularly significant as they are the first since the United Kingdom's departure from the EU. Analysts anticipate a notable shift in the Parliament's political composition. While the long-standing pro-European \"grand coalition\"—comprising the European People's Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), and the centrist Renew Europe—is expected to maintain a majority, it is projected to lose a significant number of seats. Conversely, populist and right-wing parties, such as the European Conservatives and Reformers (ECR) and the Identity and Democracy (ID) group, are expected to make substantial gains. This rightward shift could have profound implications for key EU policy areas, including climate change regulations, immigration, and the bloc's unified support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. The electoral process itself is a hybrid of common EU principles and national legislation. A core EU-wide rule is the use of proportional representation to ensure that the number of MEPs elected from a political party reflects its share of the vote. However, member states have considerable autonomy in defining their specific electoral systems, which can include closed lists, preferential voting on semi-open or open lists, or the single transferable vote system. The number of MEPs per country is determined by degressive proportionality, which allocates seats based on population while giving smaller states a proportionally larger representation, with a minimum of six and a maximum of 96 seats per country. Eligibility to vote is granted to all EU citizens in their member state of residence, with the voting age set at 18 in most countries, but as low as 16 in Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Malta. Candidate eligibility is also open to all EU citizens, with minimum age requirements ranging from 18 to 25 depending on national laws. While there are no mandated EU-wide gender quotas, 11 member states have implemented their own quotas for candidate lists to promote gender balance. Election management and integrity are primarily the responsibility of national authorities. These bodies are supported by the EU through initiatives like the European Cooperation Network on Elections, which facilitates coordination. In response to modern threats, the EU has bolstered its frameworks for cybersecurity and countering disinformation. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-EU) provide guidance and support to member states to protect electoral processes from cyberattacks. Legislative measures such as the Digital Services Act aim to create a safer online environment and combat information manipulation. Campaign finance is regulated at the EU level with a cap on donations from a single donor at €18,000 per year, though there are no EU-wide expenditure limits; these can be set by individual member states. The document also addresses provisions for marginalized groups, noting that while the EU Charter guarantees equal rights, the practical application for persons with disabilities varies significantly, with concerns about accessibility and legal restrictions in some countries. Similarly, efforts to promote women's political participation are based on guidance rather than binding regulations. Out-of-country voting is widely permitted, but procedures differ. Election observation is committed to by all member states under the 1990 Copenhagen Document, yet national frameworks for accrediting observers vary widely. After the polls close, vote counting and tabulation are conducted nationally. Official results are announced live on the EU's central election results website. Any election-related disputes are adjudicated at the national level, as there is no uniform EU procedure for election dispute resolution.",
