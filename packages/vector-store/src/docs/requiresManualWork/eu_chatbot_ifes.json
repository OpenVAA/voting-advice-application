Each\nEU Member State² sets its own election date. Voting in the Netherlands will take place on June\n6; in Ireland on June 7; in Latvia, Malta, and Slovakia on June 8; and in the remaining Member\nStates on June 9.3\nThe number of polling stations varies from country to country and depends on the size of the\nMember State.\nWhy are these elections important?\nMillions of Europeans will be able to participate in shaping the future of Europe and European\ndemocracy. In every European Parliament election, European citizens can decide collectively on\nthe future of the EU and have a say in important topics that they care about. The European\nParliament is the principal legislative and policymaking body of the bloc, and thus parliamentary\nelections shape the political trajectory and stance of the entire EU.\nThe 2024 elections, the first since the United Kingdom's 2020 exit from the EU, are particularly\ncritical, as observers predict that the elections may see higher turnout than any other since at\nleast 1994. Polls indicate that the elections could lead to significant changes in the composition\nof the Parliament. Polls and analysts anticipate that the pro-European “grand coalition” that has\ndominated EU politics since 1989 – comprising the center-right European People's Party Group;\nthe Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats; and, since 2019, the centrist Renew Europe\n(Renew) – will lose a collective 20 to 45 seats. Nonetheless, the coalition is expected to retain a\nmajority of seats and thus control of Parliament. At the same time, the elections are expected to\nsee the continued rise of populist right-wing parties, with varying degrees of opposition to EU\nintegration. In particular, those parties include the soft Euroskeptic European Conservatives and\nReformers (ECR) and the more outright Euroskeptic Identity and Democracy (ID).\nThese anticipated changes in the composition of the Parliament may have serious ramifications\nfor some of the most significant policy issues that Europe faces. Observers have noted that the\nanticipated increase in the number of seats held by the ECR and ID parties could result in a\n1 Eurostat Data Browser.

The result will be a proportionally higher\nallocation of seats to Member States with lower populations. The minimum number of MEPs from\nany country is six, and the maximum is 96.4\nElections are contested by national political parties. However, once MEPs are elected, most opt\nto join a transnational political group. Most national parties are affiliated with a Europe-wide\npolitical party. Each Member State can set the minimum electoral thresholds for national political\nparties to gain seats in the European Parliament. In the 2019 elections, the threshold for France,\nCroatia, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia was 5 percent; Austria, Italy,\nand Sweden set a 4 percent threshold; Greece set a 3 percent threshold; and Cyprus set a 1.8\npercent threshold. The remaining Member States did not set thresholds.5\nThere are currently seven political groups in the European Parliament:6\n1. Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats);\n2. Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European\nParliament;\n3. Renew Europe Group;\n4. Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;\n5. European Conservatives and Reformists Group;\n6. Identity and Democracy Group; and\n7. The Left group in the European Parliament.\nTen political parties are represented in the European Parliament7\n1. European People's Party;\n2. Party of European Socialists;\n3. Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party;\n4. European Democratic Party;\n5. European Green Party;\n6. European Free Alliance;\n7.

European Christian Political Movement.\nWhat is the electoral system?\nMEPs are elected according to national electoral systems, and thus – with the exception of certain\ncommon provisions established by EU law, such as proportional representation – Member States\nhave significant leeway to administer elections according to their own rules. In general, voters can\nchoose among political parties, individual candidates, or both. In some Member States, voters\ncan vote only for a list and cannot change the order of candidates on the list (closed list); in others,\nvoters can express their preference for one or more candidates (preferential voting). Depending\non the degree of freedom voters enjoy when casting preferential votes, they can choose between\nsemi-open lists, where they can change the position of one or all candidates on a single list, and\nopen lists, where they can vote for candidates from different lists. Instead of a list system, some\nMember States use the single transferable vote. Under this system, each voter has one vote but\ncan rank the candidates as first, second, or third choice (and so on). To be elected, a candidate\nmust receive a minimum number of votes.\nAmendments to the 1976 Electoral Act, adopted by Council Decision of July 13, 2018, include a\nmeasure on thresholds. The new rules set an obligatory threshold in certain cases for the\nallocation of seats. At the national level, this threshold may not exceed 5 percent of valid votes\ncast. Moreover, Member States that use the list system set a minimum threshold for the allocation\nof seats for constituencies that comprise more than 35 seats. This threshold cannot be lower than\n2 percent or greater than 5 percent of the valid votes cast in the constituency, including a single-\nconstituency Member State. In practice, this provision concerns only the largest Member States.\nAs the amendments have not yet entered into force, Member States will not have to comply with\nthe obligation on thresholds until at least the 2029 European elections.\nEuropean election rules that are common in all EU countries include:\n•\nElections take place during a four-day period, from Thursday to Sunday;\n•\nThe number of MEPs elected from a political party is proportional to the number of votes\nthe party receives;\n•\nEU citizens of one country who reside in another EU country can vote and stand for\nelection that country; and\n•\nEach citizen can vote only once.9\nWhat is the legal framework for conducting the elections?\nThe procedures for electing MEPs are governed both by European legislation that establishes\nrules common to all Member States and by specific national provisions, which vary among states.\n8 EUR-Lex. (2018, July 13). Amending the Act Concerning the Election of the Members of the European Parliament\nby Direct Universal Suffrage\n9 European Parliament. (n.d.). How European Elections Work.\nPage 3 of 10\n\nElections FAQs: European Parliament\nThe common provisions lay down the principle of proportional representation, rules on thresholds,\nand certain incompatibilities with the MEP mandate. National laws govern many other matters,\nsuch as the exact electoral system used and the number of constituencies. 10\nEU-wide legislation governs the composition of the European Parliament, and electoral framework\ncommon among each EU Member State. Article 14 of the Treaty on European Union defines the\nnumber of seats, degressively proportional representation, and terms for MEPs. Articles 20, 22,\nand 223, define the right to vote and stand for election for all EU citizens, the right of EU citizens\nto vote and stand for candidates in the Member State in which they reside, and defines the system\nof direct universal suffrage for EU elections.11 Act 20 September 1976,12 amended July 13, 2028\ndefines electoral procedures, including common EU-wide rules, and electoral arrangements\ngoverned by Member State national provisions. 13\nWho is eligible to run as a candidate?\nArticle 39 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights grants every citizen of the EU the right to vote\nand stand as a candidate for election to the European Parliament in the Member State in which\nhe or she resides, under the same conditions as nationals of that state.14 The minimum age to\nrun as a candidate in the European Parliament elections is established by the national laws of\neach Member State, varying from 18 to 25 years.15\nAre there reserved seats for women? What is the gender balance within\nthe candidate list?\nAs MEPs are elected from each Member State, no reserved seats are mandated for women in\nthe European Parliament. However, Member States are free to apply gender quotas for candidate\nlists. For the upcoming elections, 11 countries applied gender quotas for elections at the EU level.\nBelgium, France, Italy, and Luxembourg require 50 percent of candidates on each list to be\nwomen; Croatia, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain have a 40 percent quota, and Poland has\na 35 percent quota. Although Romanian law requires candidate lists to include women and to\nensure balanced gender representation, it does not impose a specific quota or threshold for\nwomen on candidate lists.\nWhat are the campaign expenditure and donation limits?\nDonations from citizens and legal entities are capped at €18,000 per year for each donor; any\nsingle donation in excess of €12,000 to a political party or foundation must be reported\nimmediately to the Authority for Political Parties and Foundations.\n10 European Parliament.

Per amendments approved in 2002 to the 1976 Electoral Act, Member\nStates may set expenditure limits for candidates, but there is no EU-wide limit.16\nWhat is the election management body? What are its powers?\nNational election authorities in particular central election commissions and other electoral\nmanagement bodies of each Member State – work to ensure that European elections are fair and\nfree from interference and manipulation. They do this in accordance with European and national\nlaw and with the support of EU institutions. This work includes defending the elections against\npotential attempts at information manipulation, cyberattacks, data breaches, and hybrid threats.\nThe ways that citizens vote in the European elections differ from country to country. In some\ncountries, citizens vote using ballot papers; in others they can vote electronically or online.\nEstablished routines are in place to double-check the counting of ballots regardless of how the\nvote is cast. Because small irregularities and human errors may occur in every election, systems\nare in place in each Member State to report, check, and correct possible technical errors,\nThe European Cooperation Network on Elections17 brings together Member State authorities in\ncharge of electoral matters. The individual authorities of each Member State responsible for\nensuring election integrity are listed below.\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,\nPoland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden. 18\nWhat is the election management body doing to strengthen its\ntechnology and procedures to resist vulnerabilities and counter foreign\ninterference?\nEnsuring the cybersecurity of the European elections is the responsibility of each EU country.\nThis involves protecting networks and information systems related to the elections, as well as\ntheir users, against cyberthreats that could negatively affect them, with disrupting effects for the\nelectoral process and the voters. This could include, for example, hacks or cyberattacks.\nAhead of the European elections, EU countries cooperate to prepare for potential cyberthreats.\nThey are supported by EU institutions, bodies, and agencies, such as the EU Agency for\nCybersecurity19 and the Computer Emergency Response Team20 for the EU institutions, bodies,\nand agencies. Organizing safe elections means handling personal data, such as each voter's\nname, address, date of birth, or identification number. National election authorities follow EU and\n16 EUR-Lex.

This\nincludes protecting of personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental\nloss.21\nWho can vote in these elections?\nArticle 39 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights grants all EU citizens the right to vote in\nEuropean Parliament elections following the national voting conventions of the state in which they\nreside.22 The voting age is 18 years in most Member States except Greece, where the voting age\nis 17, and in Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Malta, where the voting age is 16.23\nVoting is compulsory in only four Member States – Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, and Luxembourg\nwhere the legal obligation to vote applies to both nationals and registered non-national EU\ncitizens. In Greece, voting is not compulsory for voters over the age of 70, residents abroad, or\nvoters who are over 200 kilometers from their polling station on Election Day.\nHow many registered voters are there?\nAs of May 9, 2024, there were 358,861,608 eligible voters in the EU, including 19,757,390 first-\ntime voters.\nNational estimates indicate that the highest numbers of eligible voters for the 2024 parliamentary\nelections are expected in Germany (64.9 million voters), France (49.7 million), and Italy (47\nmillion). The lowest numbers are expected in Cyprus (700,000), Luxembourg (500,000), and\nMalta (400,000).\nThe highest number of first-time voters (those who reached voting age since the last European\nelections in 2019) are expected in Germany (5.1 million), France (4.0 million) and Italy (2.8\nmillion). The fewest first-time voters are expected in Estonia (70,000), Cyprus (37,000), and Malta\n(20,000). The highest percentages of first-time voters are expected in Belgium, France, and\nGermany, with 9.7 percent, 8.0 percent and 7.9 percent of all eligible voters, respectively. 24\nWhat provisions are in place that support the equal rights of women,\npersons with disabilities, and other marginalized groups?\nThe EU Charter recognizes the right of every citizen of an EU state to vote and run in EU\nparliamentary elections, irrespective of disability status. The Charter also explicitly recognizes the\nright to live free from discrimination on the basis of disability status.25 However, EU regulations\ndo not prescribe measures to safeguard the ability of persons with disabilities to engage with\npolitics as voters or candidates. Provisions to protect the rights of persons with disabilities and\nensure the accessibility of EU parliamentary elections vary from country to country.\n21 European Elections. (n.d.).

Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Articles 21(1),\n39(1), and 40.\nPage 6 of 10\n\nElections FAQs: European Parliament\nConsequently, observers have expressed concerns about the accessibility of EU parliamentary\nelections in various EU Member States. Only six Member States (Austria, Croatia, Italy, Latvia,\nNetherlands, and Sweden) have legal frameworks that explicitly prohibit restrictions on the right\nto vote due to court-dictated legal capacity; the other states allow for the exclusion of voters who\nhave been found “legally incapable” or placed under guardianship, resulting in the exclusion of at\nleast 400,000 voters from the 2019 parliamentary elections. Voters also face accessibility\nchallenges in some states, where polling stations, campaign messaging, election information, and\nother aspects of the electoral process are inadequate to ensure the full participation of voters with\ndisabilities. In several EU states, concerns have been raised about institutional barriers that limit\nthe ability of persons with disabilities to run for the European Parliament. These include\nstereotypes, lack of party support, and inadequate funding.26\nSimilarly, EU efforts to promote and protect the right of women to engage in the political process\nfocus largely on guidance rather than on issuing binding regulations. Article 8 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union commits Member States to working toward gender equality\nand the elimination of gender discrimination, but it does not require specific policy measures to\nachieve these goals.27 The Commission's 2020–2025 Gender Equality Strategy outlines\nrecommendations for how states can address different aspects of gender equality related to\nwomen's participation in politics, as well as domestic violence and closing the gender wage gap.\nThese, too, serve as guidance rather than requirements.28\nIs out-of-country voting allowed?\nOut-of-country voting in the EU is based on amendments to the 1976 Electoral Act, which states\nthat Member States may provide the possibility of advance voting, postal voting, and electronic\nvoting in European Parliament elections. In most cases, EU Member States allow out-of-country\nvoting in European Parliament Elections. The requirements vary from country to country; Member\nStates may require their citizens to pre-register with their national election commissions to be\neligible to vote abroad by post or via an embassy or consulate. In these circumstances, Member\nStates must ensure the results are reliable, and they must guarantee the secrecy of the votes and\nprotection of personal data. Member States may take additional measures to enable citizens who\nreside in third countries to vote in European Parliament elections. 29\nWho can observe during Election Day? How can they get\naccreditation?\nAll EU Member States are parties to the 1990 Copenhagen Document, which commits states to\nrecognizing and inviting other states and international organizations to observe their election\n26 \"Political participation of people with disabilities in the EU.” (April 2024).

Infographic: 2024 European elections: National rules.\nPage 7 of 10\n\nElections FAQs: European Parliament\nproceedings.30 However, in practice, the electoral laws of Member States vary widely in enabling\nor allowing citizens, parties, and international bodies to observe their elections.\nSeven Member States have frameworks in place for accrediting both domestic and international\nobservers (Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia); five have\nframeworks for international but not domestic observers (Austria, Czechia, Hungary,\nLuxembourg, and the Netherlands); six do not have laws explicitly pertaining to electoral\nobservation but keep their voting and counting processes open to the public (Denmark, France,\nGermany, Malta, Spain, and Sweden); and five have no frameworks for election observation at\nall (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal). Of the remaining states, Belgium permits only\ninternational observers; Latvia accredits international and domestic observers but has no\nframework; and Estonia and Slovakia allow election observation without permits.31\nWho is managing security on Election Day?\nAlthough election security – like many other aspects of EU parliamentary elections – falls under\nthe authority of each Member State, the EU has taken steps in recent years to create shared\nstandards and frameworks, particularly with regard to cybersecurity. In 2022, the European\nParliament adopted the Digital Services Act with the goal of strengthening the security of EU\nelections against disinformation and other forms of cyberwarfare. The Act went into effect in\nAugust 2023.32 More recently, the European Parliament approved the Cyber Resilience Act, which\nis designed to improve cybersecurity standards across the EU. It must still be approved by the\nCouncil of Europe and will not go into effect in time for the 2024 parliamentary elections. 33\nApart from legislative measures, the EU has sought to provide guidance and training to Member\nStates. In March 2024, the Network and Information Systems Cooperation Group, which consists\nof Member State representatives, commissioners, and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA),\nissued an updated compendium to provide guidance to Member States on securing their elections\nagainst cyberattacks.34 Shortly after the publication of the updated compendium, ENISA\norganized a cybersecurity workshop to test Member States' readiness to handle cybersecurity\nthreats. ENISA also shares biweekly analyses and reports on cybersecurity threats with key\nelectoral stakeholders. 35\nWhere are vote counting and tabulation held?\nEach Member State administers vote counting and tabulation processes within its borders; thus,\nthe locations of vote counting and tabulation will vary.\n30 Organization for Co-operation and Security in Europe.

The\nresults from each country will be posted after the final day of the European Parliament elections.36\nHow will election disputes be adjudicated?\nLegislation at the EU level does not provide uniform procedures for election dispute resolution\n(EDR). Therefore disputes, complaints, and appeals related to the 2024 parliamentary elections\nwill be governed by the national rules of each Member State and adjudicated at the national level.\nConcerns have been raised about the EDR processes and legislation of certain Member States.\nThe EU's European Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission) and\nOrganization for Co-operation and Security in Europe/Office of Democratic Institutions and\nHuman Rights have each expressed concerns regarding overly short deadlines for the submission\nand resolution of disputes; the lack of court involvement in the process; and the role of ad hoc or\nelected bodies in certifying results. 37\nResources\n•\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n• 1976 Electoral Act\n• Election Results Website\nAbout IFES's Regional Europe Office\nIFES's Regional Europe Office (REO)38 in Prague, Czechia, serves as a strategic counterbalance\nto democratic backsliding in the region and works to help build the resilience of democratic\nstakeholders in advance.
