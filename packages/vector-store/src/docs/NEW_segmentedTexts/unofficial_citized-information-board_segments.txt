## The European Union and its institutions

The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 28 member states, including Ireland. At present, the 27 other member states are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK.

The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and was originally scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019. However, its departure has now been postponed until either a withdrawal agreement is approved or until 31 October 2019.

The EU includes a number of institutions, most notably the Council of the European Union, the Commission and the Parliament. The EU also has its own budget, which comes from contributions from the member states and is spent in many different areas.


=== SEGMENT 2 ===
[Summary: The EU derives its law-making authority, resulting in mandatory laws like Regulations and Directives, from treaties signed by member states. Its historical roots lie in the post-WWII formation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), Euratom, and the European Economic Community (EEC). The EEC was the most important of these three, established by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 among six founding members, creating a customs union.]

As a result of treaties between the member states, the EU has the power to make laws on a wide range of subjects. The member states must implement these laws, which take various forms, including Regulations and Directives.

### History of the EU

What is now known as the European Union evolved from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and the European Economic Community (EEC). These communities were formed in the aftermath of the Second World War, partly in an attempt to foster economic co-operation and ensure long-term peace in mainland Europe.

The three communities had six founding members:

*   West Germany
*   France
*   Italy
*   Netherlands
*   Belgium
*   Luxembourg

The EEC was the most important of these three communities. It was created by the signature of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and came into existence in 1958. One of the main results of the Treaty was the creation of a customs union between these six countries.

Over time, the institutions for the three communities merged together and ultimately became what we now know as the Council of the European Union, the European Commission and the European Parliament.


=== SEGMENT 3 ===
[Summary: The EEC expanded significantly on January 1, 1973, with the accession of Ireland, the UK, and Denmark. Subsequent treaties, notably the 1986 Single European Act, aimed to improve functioning and create a single market. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty transformed the organization, renaming the EEC as the European Community within the wider European Union, expanding its authority into foreign policy and law enforcement, and providing for the creation of the euro, followed by further constitutional changes via the Amsterdam (1997), Nice (2001), and Lisbon (2007) Treaties.]

After a referendum in 1972, Ireland became a member state of the EEC on 1 January 1973. The UK and Denmark also joined on this date.

The member states signed further treaties to improve the functioning of the EEC and its institutions and to increase its authority in different areas. For instance, the Single European Act was signed in 1986 with the goal of creating a single market.

The Maastricht Treaty (also known as the Treaty of the European Union) was signed in 1992 and led to the re-naming of the EEC as the European Community (the EC) within a wider body known as the European Union. In addition to its economic objectives, the EU now had responsibility in the areas of foreign and security policy, and law enforcement co-operation. The Maastricht Treaty also provided for the creation of the euro.

Further amendments to the underlying constitutional structure of the EU were made by the Amsterdam Treaty (signed in 1997), the Nice Treaty (signed in 2001) and the Lisbon Treaty (signed in 2007).

## The EU institutions

The most important institutions of the EU are:

*   The European Parliament
*   The European Commission
*   The Council of the European Union
*   The European Council
*   The Court of Justice of the European Union
*   The Court of Auditors


=== SEGMENT 5 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament is the only directly elected body within the EU, with elections held every five years to choose its Members (MEPs). It currently holds 751 seats, and MEPs organize into parliamentary groups that require 25 members representing at least one-quarter of the member states to be recognized. While its powers have increased with successive treaties, it is primarily responsible for approving most European laws alongside the Council of the European Union, though it holds only an advisory role in certain areas like tax legislation.]

### The European Parliament

The European Parliament is the only directly elected body within the EU. Elections take place once every five years to elect members of the European Parliament (MEPs).

There are 751 seats in the European Parliament, although if the UK leaves the EU, the number of seats will drop to 705. MEPs generally join the parliamentary group which aligns best with their interests, to ensure that their views are given greater weight. For a group to be recognised, it must have 25 MEPs representing at least one-quarter of the member states.

The Parliament elects its own president, along with 14 vice-presidents, for a term of 2½ years. Collectively, this group is known as the Bureau of Parliament.

The leaders of the various parliamentary groups decide with the president on the Parliament's agenda and set the timetable of work for the Parliament and its committees.

The Parliament sits in Strasbourg, but there is a Secretariat based in Luxembourg and certain sessions and committee meetings take place in Brussels to facilitate contact with the Commission and Council.

#### Powers of the Parliament

With each new treaty, the powers of the European Parliament have increased. In general, most European laws must now be approved by both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. However, there are certain important areas, for example tax legislation, where the Parliament may only give an opinion as to whether a proposed piece of legislation can become law. The EU legislative procedures are explained in more detail on page 6.


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament (EP) is constrained in its legislative role, as it cannot initiate legislation but rather votes on and amends proposals exclusively put forward by the Commission. However, the EP holds critical approval powers over the annual EU budget and exercises significant supervision over the Commission. This supervisory power includes approving the Commission's President and Commissioners, and crucially, the ability to force the entire Commission to resign through a two-thirds vote of censure.]

Unlike most national parliaments, the European Parliament does not have the ability to initiate legislation. The Parliament can only vote on and amend legislation proposed by the Commission, which has exclusive power to initiate legislation. However, the Parliament can request that the Commission draw up legislation in an area.

The European Parliament also has a critical role in the approval of the annual EU budget. If the Parliament rejects the budget after negotiations with the Council of the European Union, a new budget must be drafted.

The European Parliament is responsible for supervising the other institutions of the EU, most notably the Commission. After each European election, the European Council proposes a president of the Commission. This nominee must be approved by a majority of the Parliament. The commissioners are then nominated and they too must be approved by the Parliament. The Commission must submit reports to the Parliament on its activities and must answer written or oral questions during Question Time. If two-thirds of the Parliament vote in favour of a motion of censure against the Commission, the entire Commission is forced to resign.

If a quarter of the MEPs so vote, a committee of inquiry can be set up to look into alleged contraventions or maladministration of EU law. The consent of the Parliament is also necessary to allow a new member state to join the EU.


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: The European Commission functions as the executive body of the European Union, headquartered in Brussels, and is composed of 28 commissioners, including the president, nominated by member states. All commissioners serve five-year terms and must be approved by the European Parliament, forming the College of Commissioners. The Commission meets weekly to adopt proposals and decisions, which are taken by a simple majority vote.]

### The European Commission

The Commission is the executive body of the European Union and its staff are part of the EU civil service. The Commission is based in Brussels.

The Commission is composed of 28 commissioners, one of whom is the president. There is one commissioner for each member state; each member state nominates a person to act as a commissioner. However, that person is not officially there to represent the interests of their own member state.

As noted above, the European Parliament must approve the president of the Commission and then each of the commissioners. Each individual commissioner is subjected to scrutiny by the relevant committee of the European Parliament before the vote takes place. Together, the commissioners are known as the College of Commissioners.

The president of the Commission gives each commissioner responsibility for a particular area. However, the allocation of portfolios is often the subject of much negotiation between the member states and the president. These policy areas are often closely related to the departments within the EU civil service (Directorates-General). Each commissioner has a five-year term.

The Commission meets once a week to adopt proposals, finalise policy papers and make decisions. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote. Once a decision is taken, it becomes Commission policy and has the full support of all commissioners.


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: The European Commission employs a staff of approximately 32,000 people, consisting of experts like lawyers and administrative staff drawn from all member states, to assist the commissioners in their duties. The Commission's primary powers include initiating legislation by making draft proposals and developing the annual legislative plan. Crucially, the Commission acts as the guardian of the EU treaties, ensuring EU legislation is applied across all member states and having the authority to institute proceedings against non-compliant parties.]

To assist the commissioners in the performance of their duties, the Commission employs a staff of about 32,000 people. Staff members come from all the member states and include language experts, lawyers, administrative staff, and experts in particular fields such as agriculture or industry.

#### Powers of the European Commission

The Commission has a number of important functions:

*   The Commission initiates legislation. It makes draft proposals for European laws, which are sent to the Council and European Parliament for amendment and approval. It also develops the overall legislative plan for any single year.
*   Other bodies, such as the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, can send requests to the Commission to draft legislation.
*   A piece of EU legislation can also confer power on the Commission to enact Regulations which implement the goals in that piece of legislation.
*   The Commission acts as a guardian of the EU treaties. It ensures that EU legislation is applied by all member states. It can institute proceedings against member states or businesses that fail to comply with EU law.
*   The Commission acts as an executive b

[Summary: The European Commission functions as the executive body, responsible for managing policies, drafting and implementing the annual budget, and representing the EU internationally by negotiating trade and co-operation agreements. Following this, the text introduces the Council of the European Union, which shares decision-making power with the European Parliament in areas like law-making and budget approval. The Council operates under a rotating six-month presidency and is composed of one government minister from each member state, with the specific minister attending depending on the topic being discussed.]

ody: it manages policies and drafts and implements the annual budget.*   The Commission represents the EU on the international stage. It negotiates trade and co-operation agreements with non-EU countries. However, most agreements negotiated by the Commission must be approved by both the Parliament and the Council of the European Union.### The Council of the European UnionThe Council of the European Union shares decision-making power with the European Parliament, particularly in the areas of law-making and budget approval. It is not to be confused with the European Council, which is discussed later. The Council of the European Union has a rotating presidency, meaning that a representative from a different member state chairs most of the Council meetings for a six-month period.The Council of the European Union consists of one government minister from every member state. Different groups of ministers meet depending on what topic is being discussed at the weekly meeting. For example, if the issue to be discussed at the Council is agriculture, the minister for agriculture from each member state will attend and sit on the Council.


=== SEGMENT 10 ===
[Summary: The Council of the European Union generally meets in Brussels, with exceptions for meetings held in Luxembourg during April, June, and October. Its core functions include sharing legislative power and budget approval with the European Parliament, coordinating member state economic policies through guidelines and supervision, and defining and implementing the EU's common foreign and security policy.]

The Council generally meets in Brussels. However, meetings during April, June and October are held in Luxembourg.The Council of the European Union has the following essential functions:*   The power to legislate. The Council shares this power with the European Parliament. Generally, the Council and the Parliament jointly adopt proposals for legislation that have come from the European Commission. As noted, all initial versions of legislation must be drafted by the Commission.*   The Council and the Parliament can make amendments to the legislation before either approving or rejecting it. The Council can also ask the Commission to undertake studies, which can lead to draft legislation.*   Co-ordination of the economic policies of member states. Every year, the Council drafts guidelines for the economic policies of member states. These are then made into recommendations and the Council supervises their implementation by member states.*   Development and co-ordination of the EU's common foreign and security policy. The Council defines and implements EU foreign and security policy on the basis of guidelines set by the European Council. This policy area includes the EU's development and humanitarian aid, defence and trade.*   The power to approve the budget of the EU. This power is shared with the Parliament.


=== SEGMENT 11 ===
[Summary: The Council of the European Union typically makes decisions on proposals from the European Commission using Qualified Majority Voting (QMV). QMV requires 55% of member states (currently at least 16) to agree, provided they represent at least 65% of the total EU population. To prevent a decision, at least four member states must form a blocking minority, though sensitive topics like foreign policy and taxation require unanimous consent.]

#### How the Council of the European Union makes decisionsIf the Council is considering a proposal that has been made by the Commission (which is the usual way that decisions arise), then it makes the decision using qualified majority voting (QMV). A qualified majority means that the following two conditions must be met:*   55% of the member states must agree, which is at least 16 member states currently.*   Those supporting the proposal must represent at least 65% of the EU population.To prevent a decision being made, at least four member states must form a blocking minority. This means that if fewer than four member states oppose a decision, then the Council will judge that a qualified majority has been reached.Certain sensitive topics, such as foreign policy and taxation, currently require a unanimous vote within the Council.


=== SEGMENT 12 ===
[Summary: The European Council, composed primarily of EU heads of state/government and its own president, defines the EU's overall political direction and priorities, though it is not a legislating institution. It is responsible for strategic guidelines on freedom, security, and justice. The Council also holds key appointment powers, electing its own president for a renewable 2dyear term, nominating the European Commission President, and exclusively deciding on the leadership of the European Central Bank.]

### The European CouncilThe members of the European Council are the heads of state or heads of government of the EU member states, the president of the European Council and the president of the European Commission. The Taoiseach therefore represents Ireland at these meetings. The EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy also takes part when foreign affairs are discussed.The European Council defines the EU's overall political direction and priorities. It is not one of the EU's legislating institutions, so it does not negotiate or adopt EU laws. The European Council is responsible for defining strategic guidelines on freedom, security and justice.The European Council has a number of important powers of appointment. It elects its own president for a term of 2½ years, which can be renewed once. It nominates a candidate to become the president of the European Commission. This nominee must be approved by the European Parliament. The European Council also exclusively decides on the president, vice-president and executive members of the European Central Bank.


=== SEGMENT 13 ===
[Summary: The segment first outlines the operational details of European Council meetings, which are summits held at least twice every six months in Brussels, chaired by the Council president, and primarily decide issues by consensus. It notes that neither the European Council president nor the Commission president votes when decisions are taken. Secondly, the text introduces the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the EU's judicial wing located in Luxembourg, which ensures EU law is applied consistently and settles legal disputes between governments, institutions, and sometimes individuals.]

#### European Council meetingsEuropean Council meetings are essentially summits where EU leaders meet to decide on broad political priorities and major initiatives. The Council meets at least twice every six months, normally in Brussels. When pressing issues arise, meetings can be scheduled on an ad hoc basis. This has been seen recently in the Brexit negotiations.Meetings are chaired by the European Council president. The president of the European Parliament attends the start of each meeting to outline the European Parliament's views. Other people, such as the president of the European Central Bank, may be invited to attend meetings, depending on the issues being discussed.The European Council mostly takes its decisions by consensus. However, in certain specific cases outlined in the EU treaties, it decides by unanimity or by qualified majority. If a vote is taken, neither the European Council president nor the Commission president takes part.### The Court of Justice of the European UnionThe Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the judicial wing of the European Union. It is composed of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the General Court and some specialised courts.These various courts deal with disputes between parties which involve EU law. They interpret EU law to make sure it is applied in the same way in all EU countries, and settle legal disputes between national governments and EU institutions. In certain circumstances, individuals, companies or organisations can take action against an EU institution in these courts, if they feel the institution has somehow infringed their rights. The CJEU sits in Luxembourg.


=== SEGMENT 14 ===
[Summary: The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the highest court of the EU, composed of 28 judges (one from each member state) and supported by 11 advocate generals. Cases are heard in panels, including the 15-judge Grand Chamber, and the ECJ operates collegiately, issuing a single ruling without dissents. Judges and advocate generals are appointed by member state governments for a renewable six-year term and must possess high qualifications while maintaining strict independence from other political or administrative roles.]

#### The European Court of JusticeThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the highest court of the EU. It consists of 28 judges, with one judge coming from each member state. It normally hears cases in panels of three, five or 15 judges (which is known as the Grand Chamber), depending on the importance of the issue in the case or the particular issue of European law in dispute. The ECJ acts as a collegiate body, meaning that there is only one ruling in each case. No dissents or separately concurring judgments are allowed.In addition to the 28 judges at the ECJ, there are 11 advocate generals who deliver reasoned opinions on cases to assist the ECJ in making its decisions. Each case is assigned one advocate general, although an opinion from the advocate general is not necessary in every case.Judges and advocate generals of the ECJ must have the qualifications to be appointed to the highest national courts in their member states or they may be jurisconsults (academic lawyers). Their independence must be beyond doubt. This means that once they are appointed, they may not hold any other office of an administrative or political nature and they may not engage in any occupation, paid or unpaid. They are appointed by joint agreement of the governments of the member states. They have a renewable term of six years.


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: The General Court, originally established as the Court of First Instance in 1989, currently comprises 46 judges, with plans to increase this number to two judges per member state. Unlike the ECJ, it lacks permanent advocates general and hears cases in panels of five, three, or single judges, or a 15-judge Grand Chamber, focusing on specific areas like competition law and staff disputes. Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the ECJ on points of law, reflecting the broader mission of the CJEU to uphold EU treaties and ensure consistent application of European law.]

#### The General CourtThe General Court was set up as the Court of First Instance in 1989. It includes at least one judge per member state. Currently, there are 46 judges. Later this year, its number will increase and there will be two judges per member state.Unlike the ECJ, the General Court does not have permanent advocates general. However, that task may, in exceptional circumstances, be carried out by a judge.Cases before the General Court are heard by panels of five or three judges or, in some cases, by a single judge. The General Court may also sit as a Grand Chamber (of 15 judges) when this is justified by the legal complexity or importance of the case.Matters which are initially reserved to the General Court include cases relating to breach of competition law, breach of commercial policy or social policy, and disputes concerning EU staff regulations. Decisions made by the General Court can be appealed to the ECJ on a point of law.#### Types of action before the CJEUThe CJEU upholds EU treaties and ensures that European law is interpreted and applied in the same way across the EU. It can take various forms of legal action. These include:


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: The CJEU handles several types of legal action, including preliminary rulings, which facilitate cooperation between national courts and the ECJ to ensure uniform interpretation and application of EU law. The court also handles proceedings for failure to fulfil an obligation, initiated by the Commission or a member state to enforce compliance by a member state. A third key action is proceedings for annulment, which allows applicants to seek the cancellation of EU institutional acts (like Regulations or Directives) if they are judged to be contrary to EU law; the ECJ holds exclusive jurisdiction over certain disputes between institutions or member states against the Parliament or Council.]

*   **Preliminary rulings.** To avoid differences in the interpretation of EU law by national courts, the preliminary ruling procedure allows co-operation between national courts and the ECJ. If a case comes before a national court that involves an interpretation of an EU law and there is a doubt as to how it should be interpreted, the national court will refer the question to the ECJ. The ECJ will decide how the law should be interpreted or applied. The national court must then apply that decision to the case before it.*   **Proceedings for failure to fulfil an obligation.** The Commission or a member state may commence proceedings at the ECJ to force a member state to comply with EU law. If the CJEU decides that the member state in question is at fault, the member state must rectify the situation without delay.*   **Proceedings for annulment.** This is where an applicant seeks the annulment of a measure (in particular a Regulation, Directive or Decision) adopted by an institution, body, office or agency of the EU. This type of action enables the court to review the legality of acts adopted by European institutions, bodies, offices or organisations. The ECJ can annul the act concerned if it is judged to be contrary to EU law.The ECJ has exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought by a member state against the European Parliament or against the Council of th


=== SEGMENT 17 ===
[Summary: The ECJ holds exclusive jurisdiction over annulment actions brought by a member state against the European Parliament or Council (with exceptions for state aid, dumping, and implementing powers), or by one EU institution against another. The General Court handles all other such actions, particularly those brought by individuals, who must demonstrate that the disputed law affects them both directly and individually. Parties do not need to go through national courts first; however, losing the case may result in liability for both sides' costs, while succeeding means the EU pays costs and the law is declared null and void throughout the EU.]

e European Union (apart from Council measures in respect of State aid, dumping and implementing powers) or brought by one EU institution against another. The General Court has initial jurisdiction in all other actions of this type and particularly in actions brought by individuals.Private individuals may only bring proceedings for annulment of an EU law if they can demonstrate that the disputed law affects them directly and individually. To bring proceedings for annulment, you should obtain legal advice and representation. You do not need to go through the national courts first in order to bring proceedings for annulment in the ECJ. If you lose the case at the ECJ, you may be liable to pay the costs of both sides. If you succeed, your costs will be paid by the EU and the law will be declared null and void throughout the EU.


=== SEGMENT 18 ===
[Summary: The Court of Auditors is responsible for auditing the accounts and overseeing the implementation of the budgets of EU institutions, aiming to improve financial management and provide transparency on EU spending to citizens. It produces an annual report that is published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Court is headquartered in Luxembourg and consists of 28 independent members, one from each member state, appointed by the Council for a renewable six-year term.]

### The Court of AuditorsThe Court of Auditors audits the accounts and oversees the implementation of the budgets of EU institutions. It aims to improve the financial management of EU money and to report to EU citizens on how EU money is used. It draws up an annual report at the end of each financial year. This is forwarded to the other institutions and must be published in the Official Journal of the European Union so that anyone can study the budget and spending of any particular EU institution. Members of the Court of Auditors are independent and have experience in auditing public finances.The Court of Auditors has its headquarters in Luxembourg and is composed of 28 members, one from each member state. Each member state suggests a candidate who is then appointed by the Council of the European Union in consultation with the European Parliament for a renewable term of six years.


=== SEGMENT 19 ===
[Summary: The annual EU budget process starts with a draft prepared by the European Commission, which must then be agreed upon and approved by both the European Council and the European Parliament before the next financial year. The main sources of EU income are contributions from member states (including a percentage of VAT), import duties, and fines imposed for non-compliance with EU rules. Expenditure covers running costs and major policy areas, including agricultural grants (CAP), regional development funds, job creation initiatives, environmental measures, and border control, often planned within a seven-year multi-annual financial framework.]

## The EU budgetEvery year, the European Commission prepares a draft budget. The European Council and the European Parliament must agree on the budget and approve it in advance of the next financial year.If the Council and the Parliament do not agree on the budget, the Commission must prepare a new draft.The EU's main sources of income are:*   Contributions from all member states, including a percentage of VAT collected*   Import duties on products entering the EU*   Fines imposed on businesses and member states for failure to comply with EU rulesIn addition to the expenses of running the EU, the EU budget is spent on a wide range of policy areas, including:*   Agricultural grants to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – over 80% of the EU monies received by Ireland in 2017 were agriculture related*   Regional development funds to the less well-off member states and regions in the form of cohesion and structural funds*   Monies for the creation of growth and jobs within member states*   Environmental measures*   Cultural expenditure*   Border controlA broader multi-annual financial framework spanning seven years is also agreed to allow for greater certainty in planning for income expenditure.


=== SEGMENT 20 ===
[Summary: The fundamental laws of the EU are established in treaties, which must be agreed upon and ratified by all member states, thereby becoming part of national law (e.g., Ireland ratifies treaties by referendum). The two core treaties are the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which distribute legislative authority. Most EU laws are initially drafted by the European Commission before being agreed upon by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.]

## European legislationThe fundamental laws or rules of the EU are set out in the treaties. All treaties must be agreed and ratified by the member states. A treaty is ratified when it becomes part of the law of the member states. Ratification procedures differ in member states. Ireland has ratified all treaties by referendum.The two core treaties of the EU are the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). These treaties distribute authority to make legislation to a number of bodies. As noted above, most laws are initially drafted by the Commission before being agreed by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. This legislation takes various forms.


=== SEGMENT 21 ===
[Summary: EU legislation takes several forms, including Regulations, Directives, Decisions, and non-binding Recommendations and opinions. Regulations are directly applicable laws that are entirely binding across all member states and require no transposition into national law. Directives, conversely, mandate member states to implement national legislation to achieve a specific goal, granting flexibility regarding the method used, typically with an implementation deadline. Decisions are binding only upon the limited, defined group they address, such as a single member state or a corporation.]

### Forms of legislation**Regulations.** These are laws that apply directly to everyone, including all member states. Regulations are binding in their entirety. Regulations become part of national law and are enforceable in national courts as soon as they come into force. They do not need to be transposed into national law.**Directives.** A Directive is a form of order to member states to implement national legislation to achieve a specific result. It is up to the national governments to decide on the form and method of the legislation necessary to achieve that result. This allows member states some flexibility in implementing Directives and makes it easier to do so in a way which is satisfactory to each member state. Usually, a Directive will specify a deadline for the implementation of legislation.**Decisions.** A Decision is addressed to a limited and defined group of people, for example one member state or a corporation. Decisions are binding upon the group that they address.**Recommendations and opinions.** These are not binding; they are simply recommendations. However, they may be persuasive.


=== SEGMENT 22 ===
[Summary: The Ordinary Legislative Procedure, previously known as the co-decision procedure, is the primary method for adopting the majority of EU legislation. This process begins when the European Commission submits a draft legislative proposal to both the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. If the Council disagrees with the Parliament's initial position, the legislation moves to a second reading, where the Parliament may accept the Council's amendments or propose further changes.]

### Legislative procedure#### Ordinary legislative procedureThe majority of EU legislation is adopted using the ordinary legislative procedure (previously known as the co-decision procedure). It operates as follows:1.  The European Commission submits a draft legislative proposal to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.2.  The Council of the European Union and the Parliament independently discuss and debate the legislation. Normally, the Parliament decides its position first and submits any proposed amendments to the Council.3.  If the Council agrees with the Parliament's position and/or amendments, the legislation is adopted.4.  If the Council disagrees with the Parliament's position, it sends its own amendments back to the Parliament for a second reading.5.  The Parliament may then accept the Council's amendments, in which case the legislation is adopted, or send its own further amendments back to the Council.


=== SEGMENT 23 ===
[Summary: If the Council and Parliament fail to agree after the second reading of a legislative proposal, a Conciliation Committee with equal representation is convened to draft a joint text, which must then be approved by both institutions in a third reading. Failure to agree at any stage results in the rejection of the proposal. To facilitate compromise, informal negotiations known as 'trilogues' occur, mediated by the Commission, with the Conciliation Committee meeting often referred to as a 'formal trilogue'.]

6.  If the Council accepts the Parliament's amendments, it will adopt the legislation.7.  If the two institutions do not reach an agreement after this second reading, a Conciliation Committee is convened. This has an equal number of representatives from the Parliament and the Council.
