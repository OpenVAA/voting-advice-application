[Summary: The European Parliament (EP) is one of the EU's two legislative bodies and seven institutions, responsible for adopting legislation alongside the Council of the EU. Following the June 2024 elections, it consists of 720 MEPs, representing the world's second-largest democratic electorate (around 375 million eligible voters). Since direct elections began in 1979, turnout had generally decreased until 2019, when it rose above 50% for the first time since 1994.]

The European Parliament (EP) is one of the two legislative bodies of the European Union (EU) and one of its seven institutions. Together with the Council of the European Union (known as the Council and informally as the Council of Ministers), it adopts European legislation, following a proposal by the European Commission. The Parliament is composed of 720 members (MEPs), after the June 2024 European elections, from a previous 705 MEPs. It represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India), with an electorate of around 375 million eligible voters in 2024.[4][5][6]Since 1979, the Parliament has been directly elected every five years by the citizens of the European Union through universal suffrage. Voter turnout in parliamentary elections decreased each time after 1979 until 2019, when voter turnout increased by eight percentage points, and rose above 50% for the first time since 1994.[7] The voting age is 18 in all EU member states except for Malta, Belgium, Austria and Germany, where it is 16, and Greece, where it is 17.[8]


=== SEGMENT 2 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament holds significant legislative power, as the adoption of EU legislation typically requires its approval alongside the Council, effectively creating a bicameral legislature. However, the Parliament does not possess the formal right of initiative, which is reserved for the European Commission, although both the Parliament and the Council can request the Commission to initiate a legislative proposal.]

The European Parliament has legislative power in that the adoption of EU legislation normally requires its approval, and that of the Council, in what amounts to a bicameral legislature. However, it does not formally possess the right of initiative (i.e. the right to formally initiate the legislative procedure) in the way that most national parliaments of the member states do, as the right of initiative is a prerogative of the European Commission.[9][10] Nonetheless, the Parliament and the Council each have the right to request the Commission to initiate the legislative procedure and put forward a proposal.[11]


=== SEGMENT 3 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament holds the highest protocol status as the EU's "first institution" and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council of the European Union. The Parliament exercises significant control over the European Commission, which serves as the EU's executive branch and is accountable to it. This oversight includes deciding whether to approve the nominee for President and the Commission as a whole, and the power to force the Commission's resignation via a motion of censure.]

The Parliament is, in protocol terms, the "first institution" of the European Union (mentioned first in its treaties and having ceremonial precedence over the other EU institutions),[12] and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except on a few issues where special legislative procedures apply). It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Ultimately, the European Commission, which serves as the executive branch of the EU, is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council's nominee for President of the Commission, and is further tasked with approving (or rejecting) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the current Commission to resign by adopting a motion of censure.[9]


=== SEGMENT 4 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament is led by its President, who serves as the body's speaker, and is structured around five major political groups, including the EPP, S&D, and Renew. Although the last EU-wide election occurred in 2024, the Parliament's operations are geographically dispersed. While its official headquarters are in Strasbourg, France, and administrative offices are in Luxembourg City, committee meetings are primarily held in Brussels, where the Parliament conducts business for three weeks out of every month.]

The president of the European Parliament is the body's speaker and presides over the multi-party chamber. The five largest political groups are the European People's Party Group (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), Patriots for Europe (PfE), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), and Renew Europe (Renew). The last EU-wide election was held in 2024.The Parliament's headquarters are officially in Strasbourg, France,[13] and has its administrative offices in Luxembourg City. Plenary sessions are normally held in Strasbourg for four days a month, but sometimes there are additional sessions in Brussels,[14] while the Parliament's committee meetings are held primarily in Brussels, Belgium.[14][15] In practice, the Parliament works three weeks per month in Brussels and one week (four days) in Strasbourg.

[Summary: The European Parliament was not originally designed in its current form, beginning instead as the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) when it first met on September 10, 1952. Initially, it was only a consultative assembly composed of 78 appointed parliamentarians and lacked any legislative powers. Through successive treaty changes, the Parliament transformed significantly, evolving from what was once considered a 'talking shop' into one of the world's most powerful legislatures.]

The Parliament, like the other EU institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on 10 September 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 appointed parliamentarians drawn from the national parliaments of member states, having no legislative powers.[16][17] The change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell of the University of Manchester: "For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a 'multi-lingual talking shop' [but] is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world"."[18] This was done notably through successive treaty changes and other agreements.[19]


=== SEGMENT 6 ===
[Summary: The evolution of the European Parliament reflects the European Union's structural development, which occurred without a clear 'master plan,' resulting in a complex system. A prime example of this complexity is the Parliament's three working locations, which arose from disagreements among Member States. At the 1992 Edinburgh summit, France engineered an agreement establishing Strasbourg as the official seat, even though most of the Parliament's work is conducted in Brussels.]

Its development since its foundation shows how the European Union's structures have evolved without a clear 'master plan'. Tom Reid of The Washington Post has said of the union that "nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU".[20] Even the Parliament's three working locations are a result of various disagreements and partial agreements among the governments of the Member States. Although most MEPs would prefer to be based just in Brussels, where it conducts the bulk of its work, at the 1992 Edinburgh summit chaired by John Major, France engineered an agreement whereby the European Parliament's official seat is in Strasbourg, but most of its work is done in Brussels.[16][21]


=== SEGMENT 7 ===
[Summary: The body that would become the European Parliament was absent from the original Schuman Declaration, as there was an initial assumption that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe might perform the necessary legislative tasks. However, during treaty negotiations, a separate Assembly was introduced. This new institution was specifically designed to counterbalance and monitor the executive while ensuring democratic legitimacy.]

Consultative assembly

The body was not mentioned in the original Schuman Declaration. It was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British[clarification needed] would be resolved to allow the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to perform legislative tasks. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution to counterbalance and monitor the executive while providing democratic legitimacy.[16]


=== SEGMENT 8 ===
[Summary: The ECSC Treaty demonstrated an early desire for a powerful legislative body, allowing for direct election and referring to members as "representatives of the people." This Assembly was tasked with drafting the treaty for a European Political Community (EPC), leading to the establishment of the Ad Hoc Assembly in September 1952, but the EPC project failed after the French Parliament vetoed the European Defence Community. Instead, the European Economic Community and Euratom were established by the Treaties of Rome in 1958, after which the shared Common Assembly renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly.]

The wording of the ECSC Treaty demonstrated leaders' desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by allowing for direct election and using the term "representatives of the people". Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a European Political Community. By this document, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952[22] with extra members, but after the failure of the negotiated and proposed European Defence Community (French parliament veto), the project was dropped.[23]

Instead, the European Economic Community and Euratom were established in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly.[16]

[Summary: The assembly considered the birth of the modern European Parliament held its first meeting in Luxembourg City on March 19, 1958, electing Robert Schuman as president and subsequently reorganizing itself by political ideology. The body officially adopted the name "European Parliament" in 1962, preceding the merger of the three communities in 1967, and saw its powers over the Communities' budget significantly expanded between 1970 and 1975.]

The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg City, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality.[24] This is seen as the birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.[25]

The three communities merged their remaining organs as the European Communities in 1967, and the body's name was changed to the current "European Parliament" in 1962.[16] In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas of the Communities' budget, which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975.[26]


=== SEGMENT 10 ===
[Summary: The direct election of the European Parliament, mandated by the Rome Treaties, was initially stalled because the Council failed to agree on a uniform voting system. A compromise was reached after the Parliament threatened legal action, allowing elections to proceed using national systems while postponing the decision on a uniform system. Furthermore, the assembly and later the Parliament held its sessions in the same premises as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, using the House of Europe until 1977 and the Palace of Europe until 1999.]

Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However, the Council was required to agree a uniform voting system beforehand, which it failed to do. The Parliament threatened to take the Council to the European Court of Justice; this led to a compromise whereby the Council would agree to elections, but with each Member State using its own electoral system, leaving the issue of a uniform voting systems to be decided at a later date.[27]

For its sessions the assembly, and later the parliament, until 1999 convened in the same premises as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe: the House of Europe[28][29] until 1977, and the Palace of Europe until 1999.

[Summary: The European Parliament reached a critical turning point in 1979 when its members were directly elected for the first time, a feature that distinguishes it from appointed bodies like the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Following this election, the Parliament convened its first session on July 17, 1979, where it elected Simone Veil as president, making her the first woman to hold that office since the Parliament's initial formation.]

In 1979, its members were directly elected for the first time. This sets it apart from similar institutions such as those of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe or Pan-African Parliament which are appointed.[16][30][31] After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 17 July 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its president.[32] Veil was also the first female president of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.

As an elected body, the Parliament began to draft proposals addressing the functioning of the EU.


=== SEGMENT 12 ===
[Summary: Following its direct election, the European Parliament demonstrated increased legislative initiative, most notably by drafting the "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" (the Spinelli Plan) in 1984, many ideas of which were later adopted in subsequent treaties. The Parliament also began holding votes on proposed Commission Presidents in the 1980s, preceding any formal right to veto. Regarding membership, the Parliament expanded with new nations and German reunification, leading the Treaty of Nice to impose a cap of 732 members, which the Treaty of Lisbon later raised to 751.]

For example, in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur Altiero Spinelli MEP). Although it was not adopted as such by the Member States, many of its ideas were later taken up in subsequent amending treaties.[33] Furthermore, the Parliament began holding votes on proposed Commission Presidents from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto their appointment.[34]

Since it became an elected body, the membership of the European Parliament has expanded when new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after German reunification). Following this, the Treaty of Nice imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected: 732, later raised to 751 by the Treaty of Lisbon.[16]


=== SEGMENT 13 ===
[Summary: The location of the European Parliament was initially provisional, with the Parliament seated in Strasbourg while the Commission and Council were located in Brussels. Wishing to be closer to these institutions, the Parliament built a second chamber in Brussels in 1985 and moved some operations there despite protests from certain states. A final agreement reached by the European Council in 1992 stipulated that Strasbourg would remain the Parliament's formal seat.]

Like the other institutions, the Parliament's seat was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg

[Summary: The European Parliament's contested two-seat arrangement, requiring twelve annual sessions in Strasbourg and all other activity in Brussels, was formally enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Parliament continuously gained powers through successive EU treaty revisions, notably extending the ordinary legislative procedure and gaining the right to approve international agreements. This growing influence culminated in 1999 when the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission over allegations of fraud and mismanagement, marking the first time a Commission was forced to resign.]

, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.[35]The Parliament gained more powers from successive revisions of the EU treaties, notably through the extension of the ordinary legislative procedure (originally called the codecision procedure),[36] and the right to approve international agreements through the consent procedure.In 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission.[37] The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.[38]


=== SEGMENT 15 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament's power over the European Commission evolved significantly through successive treaties, moving from only having the right to dismiss via censure to gaining appointment powers. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht gave the Parliament the right to approve or reject the incoming Commission, and the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam extended this right to the Commission President. The Treaty of Lisbon subsequently termed the Parliament's vote the "election" of the President and mandated that the European Council propose a candidate based on the European election results.]

Commission accountability to the ParliamentThe Parliament had always had the right to dismiss the European Commission in a vote of censure, but it initially had no role in its appointment. In the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht, the Member States gave the Parliament the right to approve or reject an incoming Commission. In the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, they gave it the right to approve or reject an incoming Commission President, subsequently (in the Treaty of Lisbon) describing Parliament's vote as the "election" of the President, and requiring the European Council to make its proposal to Parliament in light of the results of the European elections.[39]

[Summary: In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, the European Parliament approved José Manuel Barroso as Commission President. However, during the subsequent vote on the full Commission, MEPs scrutinized nominees using public hearings, leading to controversy over several candidates. Most notably, Parliament forced the withdrawal of Rocco Buttiglione, the nominee for Justice, Freedom and Security, over his views on homosexuality, marking the first time the Parliament had ever successfully opposed an incoming Commissioner.]

In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, the European Council proposed as Commission President a candidate, José Manuel Barroso, from the largest political party (the EPP). The Parliament approved him by 431 votes to 251. However, when it came to the vote on the Commission as a whole, MEPs raised doubts about some of the nominees following their performance in the public hearings of them conducted by Parliament's committees. Most notably, the Civil Liberties committee rejected Rocco Buttiglione for the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That was the first time the Parliament had ever opposed an incoming Commissioner and, despite Barroso's initial insistence upon Buttiglione, the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament voted to allow the Barroso Commission to take office.[40][41]

[Summary: The European Parliament demonstrated a major growth in status and assertiveness, notably when it overhauled the Bolkestein directive in 2006. Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments, fundamentally changing the proposed law. This action was described by the Financial Times as a significant shift in power, indicating that the directly elected MEPs had coalesced into a serious and effective EU institution.]

Parliament's overhaul of the Bolkestein directive signalled a major growth in status for Parliament.The Parliament also became more assertive in amending legislative proposals put forward by the European Commission. A notable example was on the Bolkestein directive in 2006, when the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The Financial Times described it in the following terms:[42]That is where the European parliament has suddenly come into its own. It marks another shift in power between the three central EU institutions. Last week's vote suggests that the directly elected MEPs, in spite of their multitude of ideological, national and historical allegiances, have started to coalesce as a serious and effective EU institution, just as enlargement has greatly complicated negotiations inside both the Council and Commission.—	"How the European parliament got serious", Financial Times (23 February 2006)

[Summary: Leading up to the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament gained influence, exemplified in 2007 when Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini included MEPs in talks on the second Schengen Information System, anticipating new powers. The Lisbon Treaty formally came into force on December 1, 2009, significantly increasing Parliament's authority by granting it powers over the entire EU budget, establishing legislative equality with the Council in nearly all areas, and formalizing the vote on the Commission President as an election.]

In 2007, for the first time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini included Parliament in talks on the second Schengen Information System even though, in this field at the time, MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated he would like to include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they were due to gain in 2009 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon.[43]Recent historyFurther information: Barroso CommissionBetween 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increased committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.[44][45]The Lisbon Treaty came into force on 1 December 2009, granting Parliament powers over the entire EU budget, making Parliament's legislative powers equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and describing Parliament's vote on an incoming Commission President Commission President as an "election", with the European Council having to make its proposal to Parliament in light of the results of the European elections.[39]

[Summary: José Manuel Barroso secured his second term as Commission President in September 2009, winning Parliament's approval with 382 votes in favor, supported primarily by the EPP, ECR, and ALDE, the latter receiving concessions. Subsequently, when Barroso presented his new Commission candidates, Parliament exercised its power by forcing Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva to step down due to concerns over her experience and financial interests, which delayed the final vote.]

Barroso gained the support of the European Council for a second term and secured majority support from the Parliament in September 2009. Parliament voted 382 votes in favour and 219 votes against (117 abstentions) with support of the European People's Party, European Conservatives and Reformists Party and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.[46] The liberals gave support after Barroso gave them a number of concessions; the liberals previously joined the socialists' call for a delayed vote (the EPP had wanted to approve Barroso in July of that year).[47]Once Barroso put forward the candidates for his next Commission, another case of MEPs opposing a particular nominee arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only had the support of the EPP which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).[48]

[Summary: Before voting on the new Commission, the European Parliament (EP) secured significant concessions defining their working relationship under the Lisbon Treaty, including attendance for the Parliament's president at high-level Commission meetings and observer status in international negotiations. Although the EP failed to gain an automatic legislative initiative or a direct vote on foreign policy appointments, they successfully used their budgetary powers to influence the structure and gain broader financial oversight of the newly established European External Action Service (EEAS).]

Before the final vote on the Commission, Parliament demanded a number of concessions as part of a future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's president will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have an observer seat in the EU's Commission-led international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. Parliament did not secure an explicit vote over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy, but it was agreed that they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would automatically put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.[49]During the setting up of the European External Action Service (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to influence the shape of the EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the High Representative. MEPs did not manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.[50][51]

[Summary: The European Parliament faced internal scrutiny regarding diversity, with a December 2017 report by Politico highlighting insufficient racial diversity, which helped launch the Brussels So White movement. While gender balance improved (reaching 40% female MEPs in the 2019-24 Parliament), the institution was hit by the Qatar corruption scandal in 2022, resulting in the arrest of four people. Additionally, in October 2023, the Parliament adopted a resolution condemning Hamas' terrorist attacks against Israel.]

In December 2017, Politico denounced the insufficient racial diversity among Members of the European Parliament.[52] The subsequent news coverage contributed to create the Brussels So White movement to campaign to rectify this situation.[53]On gender balance, some 37 percent of MEPs were women in the 2014-19 Parliament and 40 percent in the 2019-24 Parliament, a greater proposition than in most national Parliaments in Member States [54] In January 2019, MEPs supported proposals to boost opportunities for women and tackle sexual harassment in the European Parliament.[55]In 2022, four people were arrested because of corruption. This came to be known as the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament.[56]In October 2023, the Parliament adopted a resolution to condemn "Hamas' despicable terrorist attacks against Israel".[57]Moment of silence for victims of Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, October 2023

[Summary: European support for Israel diminished following reports of disproportionate attacks and civilian deaths in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank. In July 2025, the EU considered partially suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement over human rights concerns, but failed to find a majority for the suspension. Instead, the 27 EU foreign ministers agreed to closely monitor Israel's compliance with humanitarian aid access agreements and delayed decisions on further response options.]

Since then, Europe's initial and almost unconditional support for Israel started to dwindle due to the disproportionate attacks on the civilian population of Gaza and the Occupied West Bank, with tens of thousands of deaths reported. In July 2025, the EU was weighing partly suspending parts of the EU-Israel Association Agreement over reports the country is breaching its human rights obligations in Gaza.[58] A majority for a suspension was not found, but the EU’s 27 foreign ministers agreed to “keep a close watch” on Israel’s compliance with a recent agreement to improve humanitarian aid access into Gaza. They also delayed agreeing on a list of 10 options to respond to Israel's action in Gaza during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.[59]

[Summary: The European Parliament and the Council are often compared to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature, though they differ significantly from national systems, particularly regarding legislative initiative. In Community matters, the power of legislative initiative is uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive).

In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law.[61] The value of a right of initiative has anyway been questioned by noting that in the national l

[Summary: Although the European Parliament lacks a formal right of legislative initiative, it is argued to possess a de facto right as the Commission increasingly drafts legislation based on its requests. Furthermore, Parliament holds significant indirect influence through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, and its approval is mandatory for all EU development grants, impacting foreign policy matters like the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal and overseas reconstruction efforts. While Parliament's vote on new EU treaties is non-binding, its political clout is substantial, evidenced by other member state parliaments threatening to veto the Nice Treaty on its behalf.]

egislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law.[62] Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.[10]The Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, as a "pan-European soapbox" with the ear of thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States.[63] Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties and treaties amending the EU treaties, but cannot veto them. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the Belgian and Italian Parliaments said that if it did so, they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.[64]

[Summary: The European Parliament's legislative powers have continuously expanded, making the "ordinary legislative procedure" (OLP, formerly codecision) the dominant method, which places Parliament on equal footing with the Council. The OLP requires a Commission proposal to be approved by both institutions, potentially involving up to three readings. If disagreements persist after the second reading, a Conciliation Committee, composed of Council members and an equal number of MEPs, is formed to seek a compromise text, which must then be approved by Parliament.]

Legislative procedureWith each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament, in terms of its role in the Union's legislative procedures, have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the "ordinary legislative procedure" (previously named "codecision procedure"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a "common position". That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a "Conciliation Committee" is formed. The committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority.[9][65] This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.[42]

[Summary: In practice, most EU legislation is adopted at the first reading via compromise negotiations known as "trilogues," involving the Parliament, the Council, and the Commission. Special legislative procedures apply to certain areas like budget and taxation. The strongest type of EU law is a regulation (directly applicable), followed by directives (binding goals with flexible implementation), decisions (applicable to specific groups), and non-binding recommendations and opinions.]

In practice, most legislation is adopted at the first reading stage after the Parliament and the Council, having set out their initial positions, then negotiate a compromise text.[66] These negotiations take place in so-called "trilogue" meetings, in which the Commission is also present.In a few areas, special legislative procedures apply. These include justice and home affairs, budget and taxation, and certain aspects of other policy areas, such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone after consulting the other (or with its consent).[67]There are different types of European Union law#Legislation.[9] The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind member states to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is applicable to a particular person or group. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding, declarations.[68]

[Summary: The Parliament and the Council collectively form the Union's budgetary authority, operating through a procedure resembling the ordinary legislative process where Parliament holds power over the entire budget on equal footing with the Council. If a budgetary disagreement reaches conciliation but the resulting text is rejected by the Council, Parliament retains the power to adopt the budget definitively with a three-fifths majority. Additionally, Parliament possesses significant oversight through its power to discharge previous budgets, a function that notably led to the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1998.]

BudgetThe Parliament and the Council are also the Union's budgetary authority since the Budgetary Treaties of the 1970s and the Lisbon Treaty. The EU budget is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved by the Council, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively, but only by a three-fifths majority.[67]The Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to grant discharge only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the Santer Commission; highlighting how the discharge power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission.[27][38][69] Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the European External Action Service, Parliament had a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.[50]

[Summary: The European Parliament exercises significant control over the executive by formally electing the President of the European Commission and subsequently approving the entire body of Commissioners after individual hearings. While the Parliament has historically never rejected a proposed Commission or President, the potential threat of rejection is frequently utilized to secure concessions regarding the Commission's composition or policy commitments.]

Control of the executiveEuropean Parliament in 2025The President of the European Commission is proposed by the European Council on the basis of the European elections to Parliament.[39] That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a majority of members of the Parliament) who thereby "elect" the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.[70][71]In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but the threat to do so has produced concessions to Parliament on the Commission's composition or on policy commitments.


=== SEGMENT 29 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament demonstrated its evolving power and ability to hold the executive accountable by forcing the withdrawal and subsequent modification of the proposed Barroso Commission. This pressure, coupled with the tendency of MEPs to vote along cohesive party lines rather than national lines, has increased the Parliament's visibility and attention from national leaders and the public, which has helped reverse the previous decline in election turnout.]

As described above, when the Barroso Commission was put forward, the Parliament forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to Parliament.[40] That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also vote along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public – reversing the previous decline in turnout for the Parliament's elections.[72]


=== SEGMENT 30 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament holds significant control over the European Commission, notably possessing the power to censure the entire body with a two-thirds majority vote, a threat which previously led to the resignation of the Santer Commission. Furthermore, the Parliament utilizes several other control instruments, including requiring the Commission to submit reports and answer questions, obliging the Council Presidents to report on their programs and meetings, and granting MEPs the right to request new legislation.]

The Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission by a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been explicitly used, but when faced with such a vote, the Santer Commission then resigned of their own accord.There are other control instruments, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer written and oral questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the Council to present its programme at the start of their presidency; the obligation on the President of the European Council to report to Parliament after each of its meetings; the right of MEPs to make requests for legislation and policy to the Commission; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. "Commission Question Time" every Tuesday).[34][71] Regarding written and oral questions, MEPs voted in July 2008 to limit questions to those within the EU's mandate and ban offensive or personal questions.[73]


=== SEGMENT 31 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament possesses significant supervisory and scrutiny powers, largely established by the Maastricht Treaty. These powers include the ability to create Committees of Inquiry, hold other EU institutions accountable—even taking them to court for breaking EU law—and influence appointments to the Court of Auditors and the leadership of the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the Parliament elects the European Ombudsman, who is tasked with addressing public complaints of maladministration by EU institutions.]

Supervisory and scrutiny powersThe Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the Maastricht Treaty.[74] The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, which it has done, for example over mad cow disease and CIA detention flights – the former led to the creation of the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties.[75] Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors[76] and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.[75]The European Ombudsman is elected by the Parliament to deal with public complaints about maladministration (administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay) by any EU institution or body.[75]

[Summary: The European Parliament allows any EU citizen to bring petitions on matters within the EU's sphere of activities, with the Committee on Petitions hearing about 1500 cases annually and attempting resolution through mediation or legal action. The segment also details the national apportionment of the 720 total MEP seats, showing that Germany holds the largest share (96 seats), followed by France (81) and Italy (76).]

Petitions can be brought to the Parliament by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Parliament's Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.[77]MembersNational apportionment of MEP seats (total 720) Germany	96 (13.33%) France	81 (11.25%) Italy	76 (10.56%) Spain	61 (8.47%) Poland	53 (7.36%) Romania	33 (4.58%) Netherlands	31 (4.31%) Belgium	22 (3.06%) Czech Republic	21 (2.92%) Greece	21 (2.92%) Hungary	21 (2.92%) Portugal	21 (2.92%) Sweden	21 (2.92%) Austria	20 (2.78%) Bulgaria	17 (2.36%) Denmark	15 (2.08%) Finland	15 (2.08%) Slovakia	15 (2.08%) Ireland	14 (1.94%) Croatia	12 (1.67%) Lithuania	11 (1.53%) Latvia	9 (1.25%) Slovenia	9 (1.25%) Estonia	7 (0.97%) Cyprus	6 (0.83%) Luxembourg	6 (0.83%) Malta	6 (0.83%)G

[Summary: Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance; prior to the first direct elections in 1979, they were appointed by national parliaments. While approximately 40% of MEPs are women, the Parliament faces criticism for the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities; for example, only 5% of MEPs belonged to these groups after the 2019 election.]

ender of the members of the European ParliamentMain article: Members of the European ParliamentThe parliamentarians are known in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. About 40 percent are women. Before the first direct elections, in 1979, they were appointed by their national parliaments.[23][78]The Parliament has been criticized for underrepresentation of minority groups. In 2017, an estimated 17 MEPs were non-white,[79] and of these, three were black, a disproportionately low number.[80] According to activist organization European Network Against Racism, while an estimated 10% of Europe is composed of racial and ethnic minorities, only 5% of MEPs were members of such groups following the 2019 European Parliament election.[81]

[Summary: The allocation of European Parliament seats is governed by the Lisbon Treaty, setting a maximum limit of 751 members and distributing seats based on population using the principle of "degressive proportionality." Following the UK's departure, the number of MEPs settled at 720 after the 2024 elections. This system ensures smaller states receive a minimum of 6 seats and larger states a maximum of 96, leading to significantly higher voter influence in smaller countries like Malta and Luxembourg compared to the largest member states.]

Under the Lisbon Treaty, seats are allocated to each state according to population and the maximum number of members is set at 751.[82] Since 1 February 2020 and the United Kingdom's leaving the EU, 705 MEPs sit in the European Parliament. It rose to 720 after the 2024 elections.Representation is currently limited to a maximum of 96 seats and a minimum of 6 seats per state and the seats are distributed according to "degressive proportionality", i.e., the larger the state, the more citizens are represented per MEP. As a result, Maltese and Luxembourgish voters have roughly 10x more influence per voter than citizens of the six largest countries.As of 2014, Germany (80.9 million inhabitants) has 96 seats (previously 99 seats), i.e. one seat for 843,000 inhabitants. Malta (0.4 million inhabitants) has 6 seats, i.e. one seat for 70,000 inhabitants.

[Summary: The seating system implemented under the Lisbon Treaty was designed to avoid political "horse trading" when revising allocations based on demographic changes. Constituency formation follows this apportionment, varying across the EU: four member states (Belgium, Ireland, Italy, and Poland) divide their territory into multiple constituencies, while the rest use the entire country as a single constituency. Regardless of constituency structure, all member states employ various forms of proportional representation for European Parliament elections.]

The new system implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, including revising the seating well before elections, was intended to avoid political horse trading when the allocations have to be revised to reflect demographic changes.[83]Pursuant to this apportionment, the constituencies are formed. In four EU member states (Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Poland), the national territory is divided into a number of constituencies. In the remaining member states, the whole country forms a single constituency. All member states hold elections to the European Parliament using various forms of proportional representation.

[Summary: Due to the delayed ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh European Parliament was elected under the lower cap set by the Nice Treaty. A small-scale treaty amendment was ratified on November 29, 2011, creating transitional provisions that allowed 18 additional MEPs to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Furthermore, while Germany was slated to lose three seats (from 99 to 96) under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, this reduction was not implemented until the 2014 election.]

Transitional arrangementsDue to the delay in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh parliament was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011.[84] This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election.[85] Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.[86]


=== SEGMENT 37 ===
[Summary: The financial compensation system for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) changed in 2009 with the introduction of a new members statute, which standardized their monthly pay (€8,484.05 in 2016) across all member states, replacing the previous system tied to national parliamentary salaries. Besides receiving pensions and allowances for office and travel costs, MEPs are granted privileges and immunities, including protection from detention and legal proceedings in other states, though the European Parliament holds the power to waive or strip a member of this immunity.]

Salaries and expensesBefore 2009, members received the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of €8,484.05 each in 2016, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs are entitled to a pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost.[87] Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. They may then only be prosecuted after the European Parliament waives their immunity. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.[88]


=== SEGMENT 38 ===
[Summary: MEPs in the European Parliament are organized into eight different parliamentary groups, with members who do not join a group being known as non-attached members or non-inscrits. The Parliament has historically been dominated by the two largest groups, the European People's Party Group (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S&D), though no single group has ever held an absolute majority. These groups are decentralized broad alliances of national parties, resembling parties found in federal states like Germany or the United States.]

Political groupsMain article: Political groups of the European ParliamentMEPs in Parliament are organised into eight different parliamentary groups; members who do not join a group are known as non-attached members or non-inscrits.The two largest groups are the European People's Party Group (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S&D). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its existence, jointly holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats until 2019. No single group has ever held an absolute majority in Parliament.[89]As a result of being broad alliances of national parties, political groups in the European Parliament are decentralised and have more in common with parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than with unitary states, like the majority of the EU member states.[62] Nevertheless, the political groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.[90][91]


=== SEGMENT 39 ===
[Summary: Political groups in the EP are formed either around one or two European political parties, supplemented by non-aligned national MEPs and independents. To officially register, a group must have at least 23 MEPs representing seven different member states, a condition which grants them public funding. Since the Parliament does not form a traditional government, majorities are built dynamically and consensually on an issue-by-issue basis.]

Half of the groups are based on a single European political party, such as the European People's Party, with the addition of MEPs from national parties not members of a European party and independent MEPs. The others, such as the Greens–European Free Alliance group or the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, center on two European parties, as well as other national parties and independents.[92]Groups need 23 MEPs from seven different member states to register. Following registration, groups receive public funding from the budget of the European Parliament.[93]CoalitionsGiven that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of many parliamentary systems, majorities are built issue by issue. Generally, this is along broadly consensual lines with dynamic coalitions[94] rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions.


=== SEGMENT 40 ===
[Summary: Coalitions in the European Parliament typically involve the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialist and Democrat Group (S&D/PES) cooperating to find compromises, a relationship often termed a "grand coalition." When this primary alliance breaks down, the EPP seeks alliances with centre-right or right-wing groups, while the S&D/PES seeks centre-left or left-wing partners. In these alternative scenarios, the Liberal (Renew Europe) Group often assumes a pivotal position.]

These coalitions usually involve the European People's Party and the Socialist and Democrat Group of the Party of European Socialists who tend to co-operate to find compromises between them and then bring in others. Their relationship has been described as a grand coalition.[95] However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing groups. Sometimes, the Liberal (Renew Europe) Group is then in the pivotal position.


=== SEGMENT 41 ===
[Summary: Sharp party political divisions occasionally emerge in the Parliament, exemplified by the crisis leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission. Triggered by allegations primarily against socialist members, the crisis saw the Socialist Group support the executive while the European People's Party (EPP) renounced its coalition support and voted against the Commission. This dynamic created a temporary government-opposition split, reflecting increasing politicization.]

There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.[38] When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the Community budget, President Jacques Santer stated that a no vote would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. The Socialist Group initially supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, Pauline Green MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-opposition dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down.[38] Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noted that:[18]

[Summary: Politics in the European Parliament (EP) is becoming increasingly based on party and ideology, with voting splitting along left-right lines and party cohesion rising significantly, particularly in the fourth and fifth parliaments. During the fifth term (1999–2004), the traditional grand coalition broke, leading to a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties, which was reflected in the shared Presidency of the Parliament. More recently, the EPP-S&D coalition lost its majority after the 2019 European Parliament election, necessitating support from other groups, typically the liberal Renew Group or the Greens.]

Our work also shows that politics in the European Parliament is becoming increasingly based around party and ideology. Voting is increasingly split along left-right lines, and the cohesion of the party groups has risen dramatically, particularly in the fourth and fifth parliaments. So there are likely to be policy implications here too.During the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties.[96] This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the Liberals (then called ELDR), rather than the EPP and Socialists.[97] In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.[98] The EPP-S&D coalition lost their majority after the 2019 European Parliament election,[99] requiring support by at least one other political group for a majority, most frequently the liberal Renew Group or the Greens.

These elections take place over a four-day period, and while member states choose their specific electoral systems, they must adhere to common guidelines requiring universal suffrage and proportional representation. Seats are allocated based on population, with limits established since 2014 ensuring no state has more than 96 seats or fewer than 6.]

ElectionsMain article: Elections to the European ParliamentElections have taken place, directly in every member state, every five years since 1979. As of 2019 there have been ten elections. When a nation joins mid-term, a by-election is held in that country to elect its representatives. This has happened six times, most recently when Croatia joined in 2013. Elections take place on over a four-day period from a Thursday to a Sunday (each Member State votes on the day of its choice).Member States choose their electoral system within common guidelines, notably that the suffrage must be universal and that seats are allocated by proportional representation. This includes determining constituencies: while most Member States have a national constituencies, some divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member states according to their population, since 2014 with no state having more than 96, but no fewer than 6, to maintain proportionality.[100]

uropean elections (as opposed to their corresponding EP groups).[102] There have been a number of proposals designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the pan-European political parties announced, ahead of the elections, their candidates for president of the Commission, the so-called Spitzenkandidaten (German, "leading candidates" or "top candidates"). The President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and while there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful "candidate", the Lisbon Treaty states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate, and the candidate they propose must be endorsed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.[103]


=== SEGMENT 46 ===
[Summary: The text analyzes the success and failure of the Spitzenkandidaten system in the 2014 and 2019 European elections. In 2014, the system worked, resulting in the election of Jean-Claude Juncker of the EPP, the party which won the most seats. However, in 2019, despite parties announcing candidates like Manfred Weber and Frans Timmermans, the system led to a deadlock, forcing the European Council to propose Ursula von der Leyen as a compromise candidate, who was then narrowly elected.]

The Spitzenkandidaten in 2014 were Jean-Claude Juncker for the European People's Party,[104] Martin Schulz for the Party of European Socialists, Guy Verhofstadt for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, Ska Keller and José Bové jointly for the European Green Party and Alexis Tsipras for the Party of the European Left. The EPP won the most seats and Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated by the European Council and elected by the Parliament.

In 2019, the parties again announced their candidates for President of the Commission ahead of the European elections, notably Manfred Weber for the EPP and Frans Timmermans for the Party of European Socialists. However, after the election, there was no agreement among the parties after the election to back any of them. After a period of deadlock, the European Council proposed Ursula von der Leyen as a compromise and Parliament elected her, albeit by a narrow majority.


=== SEGMENT 47 ===
[Summary: In the 2024 European elections, the EPP successfully put forward Ursula von der Leyen as their Spitzenkandidat for a second term, leading to her nomination by the European Council and subsequent election by the Parliament with 401 votes, supported by the EPP, Socialists, Renew Group, and the Greens. This segment also notes that the consistent decline in European election turnout that lasted until 2014 was reversed in 2019, when turnout rose to 50.6%, the highest figure since 1994.]

In 2024, the EPP decided to back Von der Leyen for a second term of office and put her forward as their "Spitzenkandidat" while the PES put forward Nicolas Schmit. After the election, the European Council duly nominated her and the Parliament elected her by 401 votes to 284, with support from the EPP, the Socialists, the liberal Renew Group and the Greens.[105]

Until 2014, turnout dropped consistently in every election since the first election, and from 1999 until 2014 was below 50%. In 2007 both Bulgaria and Romania elected their MEPs in by-elections, having joined at the beginning of 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections saw two of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6%[106] and 28.3% respectively.[107] This trend was interrupted in the 2019 election, when turnout increased by 8% EU-wide, rising to 50.6%, the highest since 1994.

[Summary: The electoral system for European Parliament elections in England, Scotland, and Wales transitioned from a first-past-the-post system to proportional representation using regional party lists in 1999. The European Parliament’s proceedings follow a monthly cycle, alternating between committee work and part-sessions, which are held primarily in Strasbourg as mandated by EU treaty obligations, requiring the transport of materials using special relocation boxes called "cantines."]

In England, Scotland and Wales, EP elections were originally held for a constituency MEP on a first-past-the-post basis. In 1999 the system was changed to a form of proportional representation where parties put up a team of candidates in regional constituencies.[108] One could vote for a party's list of candidates, but not for an individual candidate (unless that party had a single candidate).

Proceedings

These "relocation boxes" of the European Parliament, called "cantines", are ready to be transported between Strasbourg and Brussels. The EP moves back and forth to meet the EU treaty obligation to hold plenary sessions in Strasbourg. Formally, the European Parliament has an annual "session", divided into monthly "part-sessions" and daily "sittings". In practice, this entails a monthly cycle with two committee weeks where matters are discussed in committees, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups, and session weeks where members spend 3+1⁄2 days in Strasbourg for part-sessions. In addition six 2-day part sessions are organised in Brussels throughout the year. Four weeks a year are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work, which they otherwise have to do at weekends. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks.[109]


=== SEGMENT 49 ===
[Summary: The European Parliament operates autonomously, guided by its own "Rules of Procedure," and holds debates that are generally calmer than systems like Westminster, partly due to the need for interpretation and consensus. While voting is primarily conducted by a show of hands, roll-call ballots—where votes are recorded—are mandatory for final legislation or when requested by a political group or 30 MEPs. To avoid disrupting the schedule, votes are usually grouped together, typically occurring around noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays.]

The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly set out by the treaties but are otherwise up to Parliament according to its own "Rules of Procedure" (the regulations governing the parliament).[110]

During sittings, members may speak after being called on by the President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates.[111][112] Partly due to the need for interpretation, and the politics of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system.[113] Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting.[114] Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected).[115][116] All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online.[117] Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.[118]

[Summary: The European Parliament employs a hemicycle seating arrangement where members are organized by political groups, positioned mainly from left to right, contrasting with the alphabetical seating used before 1958. The chamber is technologically equipped for debate and electronic voting, with designated areas for group leaders, the President, the Council (far left), and the Commission (far right). This hemicycle layout represents a compromise between different national parliamentary systems, primarily drawing from the French semicircle model.]

Members sit in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically[119]) who are ordered mainly by left to right. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for listening to interpretation, and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the Groups sit on the front benches, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences.[120] The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other.[119]

[Summary: The segment describes the role of ushers in the European Parliament, who control chamber access, assist MEPs, and enforce the President's authority, following a protocol based on the French model. It then details the role of the President, who acts as the speaker, presides over the plenary, and whose signature is required for all co-decided acts, including the EU budget. The President is elected for a two-and-a-half-year term, with Roberta Metsola currently holding the office.]

Access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who also aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited in the same manner as the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.[121]

[Summary: The President of the European Parliament holds the highest protocol ranking within the EU, superseding all other European or national protocols. Historically, the position has been held by notable figures including founding father Paul-Henri Spaak, the first elected President Simone Veil, and the first East-Central European leader, Jerzy Buzek. During the election process for a new President, the previous President presides over the chamber, a rule changed in 2009 to prevent the oldest member, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from taking the chair.]

In most countries, the protocol of the head of state comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol ranking of its president comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depend upon the President. President Josep Borrell MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona who had engraved upon it parts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights among other things.[12]

A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP,[125] one of the founding fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The three female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament), Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen, and Roberta Metsola from Malta in 2022.[126] The previous president, Jerzy Buzek was the first East-Central European to lead an EU institution, a former Prime Minister of Poland who rose out of the Solidarity movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the Eastern Bloc.[127]

During the election of a President, the previous President (or, if unable to, one of the previous vice-presidents) presides over the chamber.[128] Prior to 2009, the oldest member fulfilled this role[129] but the rule was changed to prevent far-right French MEP Jean-Marie Le Pen taking the chair.[128]

The Parliament also elects 14 Vice-Presidents who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of bodies responsible for the running of Parliament. The two main ones are the Bureau, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues and is

Committees and delegationsA Committee roomMain article: Committees of the European ParliamentThe Parliament has 20 Standing Committees ranging in size from 25 to 88 MEPs (each reflecting the political make-up of the whole Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary.[132] The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case: in the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.[38]The Parliament can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the Subcommittee on Human Rights) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. the Special Committee on Foreign Interference in Democratic Processes in the European Union, 2020–23). The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the "Conference of Committee Chairmen".[132]

[Summary: The committees of the European Parliament differ from national counterparts, notably possessing unusually large secretariats by European standards, typically staffed by eight to twelve dedicated members plus support staff, though they are smaller than US Congress committees. Furthermore, the Parliament utilizes 44 delegations, which manage relations with parliaments outside the EU; these delegations are mostly small (around 15 MEPs) and their chairpersons coordinate their work in a conference.]

The nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the United States Congress, the European Parliament's committee secretariats are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.[62]Delegations of the Parliament are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 44 delegations, mostly small (around 15 MEPs) but some larger. Chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do.


=== SEGMENT 56 ===
[Summary: European Parliament delegations are structured into several types, including Interparliamentary delegations, which handle relations with Parliaments outside the EU, and joint parliamentary committees, which focus on relations with EU candidate or associate states. Specific delegations also exist for bodies like the ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. Furthermore, MEPs engage in other international activities, such as participating in the NATO Assembly, the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue, and election observation missions in third countries.]

Delegations include "Interparliamentary delegations" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), "joint parliamentary committees" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the delegation to the ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.[132] MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the NATO Assembly, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and through election observation in third countries.[133]

[Summary: Intergroups in the European Parliament are informal, cross-party fora designed to address topics transversal to several committees in a less formal setting, though they do not represent the official view of the Parliament. Historically, their secretariats were often run by interest groups, leading to their multiplication in the 1990s due to favored access to MEPs. Consequently, Intergroups are now strictly regulated, requiring official declaration of any financial support, and must be established or renewed at the start of each legislature with support from at least three political groups.]

IntergroupsJože Pučnik conference roomThe Intergroups in the European Parliament are informal fora which gather MEPs from various political groups around any topic. They do not express the view of the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s.[134] They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example), must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests.[135][136] Also Intergroups are established or renewed at the beginning of each legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups who can each support a limited number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014–2019, the EPP or S&D political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).[137]

[Summary: Due to the large number of languages, the European Parliament utilizes specialized interpreting methods like the "retour" system (translating out of the native tongue, used since 1995) and "relay" interpreting (using a third language when interpreters are lacking). Interpretation is complex and not word-for-word; interpreters must convey the political meaning of the speech, requiring detailed political understanding and preparation. Challenges frequently arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes, word play, or speak too quickly.]

Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator's native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the "retour" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters ("relay" interpreting) – for example, when interpreting out of Estonian into Maltese.[139] Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.[139]

[Summary: The high cost of interpretation has drawn criticism, exemplified by a 2006 report suggesting massive savings (€118,000 down to €8,900 daily) if translation were limited to English, French, and German. Separately, there has been a campaign to adopt French as the standard reference language for legal texts due to its perceived clarity. These translated proceedings have also been compiled into the Europarl corpus, a resource frequently used to train statistical machine translation systems.]

While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from €118,000 per day (for 21 languages then – Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day.[141] There has also been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, on the basis of an argument that it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.[142]Because the proceedings are translated into all of the official EU languages, they have been used to make a multilingual corpus known as Europarl. It is widely used to train statistical machine translation systems.[143]

[Summary: The segment compares the high costs of the European Parliament (EP) to national bodies, noting that the EP is estimated to cost more than the British, French, and German parliaments combined. Major cost factors include translation and interpretation (c. €460 million) and the expense of maintaining double seats (estimated at €180 million annually). Additionally, MEPs rejected a proposal in July 2018 to tighten accountability rules for the controversial €4,416 monthly General Expenditure Allowance.]

As a comparison, the German lower house of parliament (Bundestag) is estimated to cost €517 million in total for 2018, for a parliament with 709 members.[176] The British House of Commons reported total annual costs in 2016–2017 of £249 million (€279 million). It had 650 seats.[177]

According to The Economist, the European Parliament costs more than the British, French and German parliaments combined. A quarter of the costs is estimated to be related to translation and interpretation costs (c. €460 million) and the double seats are estimated to add an additional €180 million a year.[178] For a like-for-like comparison, these two cost blocks can be excluded.

On 2 July 2018, MEPs rejected proposals to tighten the rules around the General Expenditure Allowance (GEA),[179] which "is a controversial €4,416 per month payment that MEPs are given to cover office and other expenses, but they are not required to provide any evidence of how the money is spent".[180]

[Summary: The Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament, initially intended as a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation, is now heavily criticized due to the cost and inconvenience of the two-seat arrangement. While Strasbourg remains the official seat, Brussels hosts nearly all other major EU institutions and handles the majority of the Parliament's work, fueling a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. Critics, including former Commission First-Vice President Margot Wallström, have labeled the dual location system a wasteful "travelling circus."]

The Strasbourg seat is considered a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, two countries that previously fought over the region. However, the cost and inconvenience of having two seats is questioned. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the Council of Europe,[182] Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions, with the majority of Parliament's work being carried out there. Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a "travelling circus",[183] and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is because the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the 'capital' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing from numerous figures, including Margot Wallström, Commission First-Vice President from 2004 to 2010, who stated that "something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol – of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions".[184]

[Summary: The opposition to the European Parliament's dual seat arrangement is strongly supported by financial and environmental data. A Green Party study estimated the costs of the extra seat at €200 million and 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, while the European Court of Auditors calculated in 2014 that relocating the Strasbourg seat to Brussels would save €113.8 million annually. This movement is also backed by a million-strong online petition and historical allegations of irregularities concerning Strasbourg's rental charges in 2006.]

The Green Party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert MEP and Caroline Lucas MEP; in addition to the extra 200 million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union.[183] The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by Cecilia Malmström MEP.[185] In August 2014, an assessment by the European Court of Auditors calculated that relocating the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament to Brussels would save €113.8 million per year.[186] In 2006, there were allegations of irregularities in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented, thus further harming the case for the Strasbourg seat.[187]

[Summary: The vast majority of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) favor establishing Brussels as the sole seat, with polls showing strong support for abandoning the dual-seat arrangement, and an absolute majority voting in favor of a single seat in 2011. However, the seat is fixed by treaties and can only be changed by a unanimous vote of all Member States, allowing France, whose former President Nicolas Sarkozy declared the Strasbourg seat "non-negotiable," to veto any relocation. This political deadlock has led some MEPs to advocate for civil disobedience by refusing to attend the mandatory monthly sessions in Strasbourg.]

Most MEPs prefer Brussels as a single base.[188] A poll of MEPs found 89% of the respondents wanting a single seat, and 81% preferring Brussels.[189] Another survey found 68% support.[18] In July 2011, an absolute majority of MEPs voted in favour of a single seat.[190] In early 2011, the Parliament voted to scrap one of the Strasbourg sessions by holding two within a single week.[191] The mayor of Strasbourg officially reacted by stating "we will counter-attack by upturning the adversary's strength to our own profit, as a judoka would do".[192] However, as Parliament's seat is now fixed by the treaties, it can only be changed by the Member States, acting unanimously and with national ratification, meaning that France could veto any move.[181] Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated that the Strasbourg seat is "non-negotiable" and that France has no intention of surrendering the only EU Institution on French soil.[193] Given France's declared intention to veto any relocation to Brussels, some MEPs have advocated civil disobedience by refusing to take part in the monthly exodus to Strasbourg.[194][195][196]

However, the main building in Brussels has been suffering for more than a decade from a state of degradation. Renovation or reconstruction works including a hemicycle were estimated to cost at least €500 million in 2017 with fear that the cost would be even higher[197] and possibly escalate up to €1 billion,[198] whereas the seat in Strasbourg already offers a fully-fledged hemicycle.

Channels of dialogue, information, and communication with European civil society
Individual MEPs are the main point of contact for citizens with the Parliament. They normally have an office in their constituency and travel back at the end of every week (and during weeks without parliamentary meetings) to participate in an array of meetings, events, interviews, visits and suchlike with voters, businesses, trade unions, local authorities and media.

The Parliament itself maintains a detailed website,[199] receives around one million visitors a year, and streamlines debates and committee meetings.

Over the last few years, European institutions have committed to promoting transparency, openness, and the availability of information about their work.[200] In particular, transparency is regarded as pivotal to the action of European institutions and a general principle of EU law, to be applied to the activities of EU institutions in order to strengthen the Union's democratic foundation.[201] The general principles of openness and transparency are reaffirmed in the articles 8 A, point 3 and 10.3 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Maastricht Treaty respectively, stating that "every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Uni

The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties.[207] In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.[207]
