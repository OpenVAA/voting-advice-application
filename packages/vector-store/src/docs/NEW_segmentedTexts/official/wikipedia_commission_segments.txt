[Summary: The European Commission (EC) is the primary executive branch of the European Union (EU), operating as a cabinet government led by members known informally as commissioners. While the number of commissioners historically corresponded to two-thirds of the member states, the current body comprises 27 commissioners, including the president. The EC manages an administrative body of approximately 32,000 civil servants and is structurally divided into departments called Directorates-General (DGs), which are headed by a director-general responsible to a commissioner.]

The European Commission (EC) is the primary executive branch of the European Union (EU).It operates as a cabinet government, with a number of members of the Commission (directorial system, informally known as "commissioners") corresponding to two thirds of the number of member states, unless the European Council, acting unanimously, decides to alter this number.[1]The current number of commissioners is 27, including the president.[2][3] It includes an administrative body of about 32,000 European civil servants. The commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries each headed by a director-general who is responsible to a commissioner.

[Summary: The European Commission currently consists of one member per member state, and these members are bound by oath to represent the general interest of the EU rather than their home state. The selection process involves the European Council proposing the President (currently Ursula von der Leyen), who is then elected by the European Parliament. The remaining members are nominated by the Council of the European Union, and the entire team must ultimately receive a vote of approval from the European Parliament.]

Currently, there is one member per member state, but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.[4] The Commission president (currently Ursula von der Leyen) is proposed by the European Council[5] (the 27 heads of state/governments) and elected by the European Parliament.[6] The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated president, and the 27 members as a team are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.[7]The current Commission is the von der Leyen Commission II, which took office in December 2024, following the European Parliament elections in June of the same year.

[Summary: The European Commission (EC) originated from one of the five key institutions created in the supranational European Community system, following the proposal of French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman on May 9, 1950. It began in 1951 as the High Authority in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The institution has since undergone numerous changes in power and composition, formalized by treaties including the Merger Treaty (1965) and the Lisbon Treaty (2007).]

[Summary: The first executive body, established in 1951 for the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), was the nine-member "High Authority" led by President Jean Monnet, which took office in Luxembourg City on August 10, 1952. When the Treaties of Rome established the European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom in 1958, their executives were termed "Commissions" instead of "High Authorities." This change in nomenclature reflected the desire of states, such as France, to limit the power of the supranational executive and grant more authority to the Council.]

The first Commission originated in 1951 as the nine-member "High Authority" under President Jean Monnet (see Monnet Authority). The High Authority was the supranational administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It took office first on 10 August 1952 in Luxembourg City. In 1958, the Treaties of Rome had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). However, their executives were called "Commissions" rather than "High Authorities".[8] The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the Council. Some states, such as France, expressed reservations over the power of the High Authority and wished to limit it by giving more power to the Council rather than the new executives.[9]

[Summary: Louis Armand led the first Euratom Commission, while Walter Hallstein led the first EEC Commission, holding its initial formal meeting on January 16, 1958. Hallstein's administration was highly influential, consolidating European law and successfully debuting internationally at the Kennedy Round of GATT negotiations. However, the 1965 "empty chair" crisis, triggered by disputes with Charles de Gaulle's French government, ultimately cost Hallstein his presidency, despite him being considered the most dynamic leader until Jacques Delors.]

Walter Hallstein, the first President of the CommissionLouis Armand led the first Commission of Euratom. Walter Hallstein led the first Commission of the EEC, holding the first formal meeting on 16 January 1958 at the Château of Val-Duchesse. It achieved agreement on a contentious cereal price accord, as well as making a positive impression upon third countries when it made its international debut at the Kennedy Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations.[10] Hallstein notably began the consolidation of European law and started to have a notable impact on national legislation. Little heed was taken of his administration at first but, with help from the European Court of Justice, his Commission stamped its authority solidly enough to allow future Commissions to be taken more seriously.[11] In 1965, however, accumulating differences between the French government of Charles de Gaulle and the other member states on various subjects (British entry, direct elections to Parliament, the Fouchet Plan and the budget) triggered the "empty chair" crisis, ostensibly over proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy. Although the institutional crisis was solved the following year, it cost Étienne Hirsch his presidency of Euratom and later Walter Hallstein the EEC presidency, despite his otherwise being viewed as the most 'dynamic' leader until Jacques Delors.[10]

[Summary: This period of the European Commission saw the Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions focus on monetary co-operation and manage the first enlargement to the north in 1973. This enlargement increased the College of Commissioners to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission, which navigated international economic instability. External representation improved under President Roy Jenkins, who became the first Commission President to attend a G8 summit, while the subsequent Gaston Thorn Commission oversaw enlargement to the south and began work on the Single European Act.]

The Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions followed with work on monetary co-operation and the first enlargement to the north in 1973.[14][15] With that enlargement, the College of Commissioners membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission (the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners), which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time.[12][16] The external representation of the Community took a step forward when President Roy Jenkins, recruited to the presidency in January 1977 from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom's Labour government,[17] became the first President to attend a G8 summit on behalf of the Community.[18] Following the Jenkins Commission, Gaston Thorn's Commission oversaw the Community's enlargement to the south, in addition to beginning work on the Single European Act.[19]

During his tenure, he championed the creation of the single market in his first term before moving toward the more ambitious goals of economic, monetary, and political union.]

Jacques DelorsJacques Delors, the European Commission president from 1985–1994Main article: Delors CommissionThe Commission headed by Jacques Delors was seen as giving the Community a sense of direction and dynamism.[20] Delors and his College are also considered as the "founding fathers of the euro".[21] The International Herald Tribune noted the work of Delors at the end of his second term in 1992: "Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst. Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary, and political union".[22]

[Summary: The Santer Commission was forced to resign en masse in 1999 due to a fraud and corruption scandal revealed by internal auditor Paul van Buitenen, the first such event which marked a shift of power toward the Parliament and resulted in the creation of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Succeeding Santer, Romano Prodi took office as the Commission's powers were strengthened by the Amsterdam Treaty, leading the press to dub him akin to a Prime Minister. Further strengthening occurred with the Treaty of Nice (2001), which granted the Commission President more control over the composition of the College of Commissioners.]

Jacques SanterMain article: Santer CommissionThe successor to Delors was Jacques Santer. As a result of a fraud and corruption scandal, the entire Santer Commission was forced by the Parliament to resign in 1999. These frauds were revealed by internal auditor Paul van Buitenen, with French commissioner Édith Cresson being the main target of the allegations.[23][24]That was the first time a College of Commissioners had been forced to resign en masse, and represented a shift of power towards the Parliament.[25] However, the Santer Commission did carry out work on the Treaty of Amsterdam and the euro.[26] In response to the scandal, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) was created.Romano ProdiMain article: Prodi CommissionFollowing Santer, Romano Prodi took office. The Amsterdam Treaty had increased the commission's powers and Prodi was dubbed by the press as something akin to a Prime Minister.[27][28] Powers were strengthened again; the Treaty of Nice, signed in 2001, gave the Presidents more power over the composition of the College of Commissioners.[8]

[Summary: José Manuel Barroso assumed the presidency of the European Commission in 2004, but only after the Parliament asserted its authority by objecting to the proposed membership, forcing him to reshuffle his College of Commissioners. This Commission was the first full body appointed following the 2004 enlargement, which expanded the EU to 25 members. Consequently, the Amsterdam Treaty provisions were implemented, reducing the number of Commissioners to one per member state.]

José Manuel BarrosoMain article: Barroso CommissionJosé Manuel Barroso became president in 2004: the Parliament once again asserted itself in objecting to the proposed membership of the Barroso Commission. Owing to this opposition, Barroso was forced to reshuffle his College before taking office.[29] The Barroso Commission was also the first full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members; hence, the number of Commissioners at the end of the Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.[12]

[Summary: The period around Barroso's first term continued to face issues of fraud and corruption, highlighted by allegations from former chief auditor Jules Muis and the firing of Commission officer Guido Strack after he reported abuses to OLAF. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) itself faced criticism in 2008 regarding its independence and effectiveness. Following the expiration of Barroso's first term on October 31, 2009, rules laid out in the Treaty of Nice concerning the reduction of Commissioners—triggered by the EU reaching 27 member states—were set to take effect for the subsequent Commission.]

Allegations of fraud and corruption were again raised in 2004 by former chief auditor Jules Muis.[30] A Commission officer, Guido Strack, reported alleged fraud and abuses in his department in the years 2002–2004 to OLAF, and was fired as a result.[31] In 2008, Paul van Buitenen (the former auditor known from the Santer Commission scandal) accused the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of a lack of independence and effectiveness.[32]Barroso's first Commission term expired on 31 October 2009. Under the Treaty of Nice, the first Commission to be appointed after the number of member states reached 27 would have to be reduced to "less than the number of Member States". The exact number

[Summary: This segment details the complex rules governing the size and rotation of the European Commission, stemming from the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007, the Nice rules requiring the European Council to unanimously decide the number of Commissioners took effect. The Lisbon Treaty, which became effective in December 2009, mandated a reduction to two-thirds of member states from 2014; however, this provision was complicated by Ireland's 2008 rejection, leading to a guarantee that the Council would use its power to increase the number, resulting in the '26+1 formula' compromise.]

of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the European Council, and membership would rotate equally between member states. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007, this clause took effect for the next Commission.[33] The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, mandated a reduction of the number of commissioners to two-thirds of member-states from 2014 unless the Council decided otherwise. Membership would rotate equally and no member state would have more than one Commissioner. However, the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner. Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards. However, according to the treaties it still has to be fewer than the total number of members, thus it was proposed that the member state that does not get a Commissioner would get the post of High Representative – the so-called 26+1 formula.[34][35] This guarantee (which may find its way into the next treaty amendment, probably in an accession treaty) contributed to the Irish approving the treaty in a second referendum in 2009.

[Summary: The Treaty of Lisbon introduced significant institutional changes, notably combining the European Commissioner for External Relations and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy into a single Vice-President post. Lisbon also strengthened the European Parliament's role in appointing the Commission President, requiring the Parliament to "elect" the proposed candidate based on recent election results, rather than merely "approve" them. Jean-Claude Juncker became President of the European Commission in 2014 and appointed Martin Selmayr, who was described as the most powerful EU chief of staff ever.]

Lisbon also combined the posts of European Commissioner for External Relations with the council's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. This post, also a Vice-president of the Commission, would chair the Council of the European Union's foreign affairs meetings as well as the commission's external relations duties.[36][37] The treaty further provides that the most recent European elections should be "taken into account" when appointing the President of the European Commission, and although they are still proposed by the European Council; the European Parliament "elects" candidates to the office, rather than "approves" them as under the Treaty of Nice.[7][36]

The Barroso Commission is, in reaction to Euroscepticism, said to have toned down enforcement to increase integration.[38][39]

In 2019, Ursula von der Leyen was appointed as President of the European Commission. She submitted the guidelines of her policy to the European Parliament on 16 July 2019, following her confirmation. She had not been considered a likely candidate (in general, the elected candidate is determined, according to the results of the European election, as winner of the internal election into the dominant European party known as "spitzenkandidat"). While the European People's Party had won the European Parliament election, they had performed worse than expected and therefore nominated von der Leyen instead of Manfred Weber, their original candidate. On 9 September, the Council of the European Union declared a list of candidate-commissioners, which are sent to Brussels by the governments of each member state and which had to be officially approved by the parliament.[41]

In September 2024, Von der Leyen revealed her new team of European Commissioners, marking a shift to a "leaner" and more interconnected structure. The lineup featured six executive vice-presidents (EVPs) from France, Finland, Estonia, Italy, Romania, and Spain. These EVPs, including Teresa Ribera and Stéphane Séjourné, were tasked with overseeing various clusters of Commissioners and steering key policy areas such as prosperity, security, and democracy. Raffaele Fitto was appointed despite criticism from European socialists over his hard-right affiliations. Other notable appointments included Kaja Kallas as EVP for Foreign and Security Policy, and Henna Virkkunen as EVP for Tech Sovereignty and Digital Technologies. The Commission also introduced new roles like the Commissioner for Defence and Security and the Commissioner for the Mediterranean.[42]


=== SEGMENT 16 ===
[Summary: The European Commission functions as an independent supranational authority, distinguished from bodies representing national governments or citizens. Although commissioners are proposed by member states, they are legally bound to act independently, focusing solely on European interests. Its core responsibilities, outlined in Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union, include drafting legislation, representing the EU in trade negotiations, establishing rules, drawing up the EU budget, and scrutinizing the implementation of treaties and legislation.]

Powers and functions
The commission was set up from the start to act as an independent supranational authority separate from governments; it has been described as "the only body paid to think European".[43] The members are proposed by their member state governments, one from each. However, they are bound to act independently – free from other influences such as those governments which appointed them. This is in contrast to the Council of the European Union, which represents governments, the European Parliament, which represents citizens, the Economic and Social Committee, which represents organised civil society, and the Committee of the Regions, which represents local and regional authorities.[44]

Through Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union the commission has several responsibilities: to develop medium-term strategies; to draft legislation and arbitrate in the legislative process; to represent the EU in trade negotiations; to make rules and regulations, for example in competition policy; to draw up the budget of the European Union; and to scrutinise the implementation of the treaties and legislation.[45] The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the commission's operation and organisation.[46]


=== SEGMENT 17 ===
[Summary: Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the Council held the EU's executive power, conferring it upon the Commission while retaining the ability to withdraw or condition those powers. Following the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission exercises its powers directly by virtue of the treaties, although its scope is limited, particularly lacking control over foreign policy. While the European Council (now a formal institution) shares influence and appointing power, the Commission currently holds most of the executive power over the European Union.]

Executive power
Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the executive power of the EU was held by the council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use.[47][48] This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just by virtue of the treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy – that power is held by the Council of the European Union and the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.[49]

Considering that under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Council has become a formal institution with the power of appointing the commission, it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the EU (the European Council also holds individual national executive powers). However, it is the Commission that currently holds most of the executive power over the European Union.[49][50]


=== SEGMENT 18 ===
[Summary: The European Commission holds a unique monopoly on legislative initiative within the EU, meaning it is the sole body that can make formal proposals for legislation, a structure designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. While the Council and Parliament may request legislation, the Commission retains the power to refuse, and under the Treaty of Lisbon, legislative acts are explicitly disallowed in the field of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The Lisbon Treaty also allows EU citizens to submit a non-binding request for legislation via a petition carrying one million signatures.]

Legislative initiative
The Commission differs from the other institutions in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed in the field of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields, the Council and Parliament can request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates on the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law.[51][52] This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects.[53] However, the Council and Parliament may request the commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so[54] as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions.[55] Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is not binding.[56]


=== SEGMENT 19 ===
[Summary: The European Commission primarily focuses its law-proposing powers on economic regulation, frequently utilizing a "precautionary principle" to enact pre-emptive regulations concerning environmental or human health hazards, such as climate change and genetically modified organisms. This commitment to strict standards, exemplified by the goal of EU carbon neutrality by 2050, makes EU legislation a powerful influence in the global market. Furthermore, the Commission published the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive in February 2022, which mandates corporate frameworks to identify and mitigate risks to human rights and the environment.]

The commission's powers in proposing law have usually centred on economic regulation. It has put forward a large number of regulations based on a "precautionary principle". This means that pre-emptive regulation takes place if there is a credible hazard to the environment or human health: for example on tackling climate change and restricting genetically modified organisms. The European Commission has committed EU member states to carbon neutrality by 2050.[57][58] This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the economy. Thus, the Commission often proposes stricter legislation than other countries. Owing to the size of the European market, this has made EU legislation an important influence in the global market.[59] On February 23, 2022, the European Commission published the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive which establishes a framework of due diligence for companies to identify actual or potential risks and harm to human rights and the environment as well as establishing processes and standards to diminish these risks. The Directive is expected to be officially adopted in 2024 and then be incorporated into domestic laws within two years by all of the European Union member states.

[Summary: The European Commission recently expanded its legislative role by moving into the creation of European criminal law, a development spurred by a 2006 toxic waste spill that led to the proposal of "ecological crimes." Although the Commission's right to propose criminal law was challenged, it was upheld by the European Court of Justice. As of 2007, other criminal law proposals included directives on intellectual property rights and amendments to the 2002 counter-terrorism framework.]

Recently the commission has moved into creating European criminal law. In 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire, from a European ship, prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. at that time did not even have a crime against shipping toxic waste; this led the Commissioners Franco Frattini and Stavros Dimas to put forward the idea of "ecological crimes". Their right to propose criminal law was challenged in the European Court of Justice but upheld. As of 2007, the only other criminal law proposals which have been brought forward are on the intellectual property rights directive,[60] and on an amendment to the 2002 counter-terrorism framework decision, outlawing terrorism‑related incitement, recruitment (especially via the internet) and training.[61]

r states or through its agencies. In adopting the necessary technical measures, the commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states and of the public and private lobbies[62] (a process known in jargon as "comitology").[63] Furthermore, the commission is responsible for the implementation of the EU budget, ensuring, along with the Court of Auditors, that EU funds are correctly spent.In particular the commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld, potentially by taking member states or other institutions to the Court of Justice in a dispute. In this role it is known informally as the "Guardian of the Treaties".[44] Finally, the Commission provides some external representation for the Union, alongside the member states and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, representing the Union in bodies such as the World Trade Organization. It is also usual for the President to attend meetings of the G7.[44]


=== SEGMENT 22 ===
[Summary: The College of Commissioners, consisting of 27 members including the President and vice-presidents, forms the leadership of the Commission. Although nominated by national governments (one per state), these members do not officially represent their state. The President assigns specific portfolios, which determine the power and visibility of each Commissioner, such as the globally prominent Competition Commissioner. The College must be approved as a whole by the Parliament before it can assume office.]

College of CommissionersFor members of the current Commission, see Von der Leyen Commission II.The commission is composed of a "College of Commissioners" of 27 members, including the President and vice-presidents. Even though each member is nominated on the basis of the suggestions made by the national governments, one per state, they do not represent their state in the commission.[64] In practice, however, they do occasionally press for their national interest.[65] Once proposed, the President delegates portfolios among each of the members. The power of a Commissioner largely depends upon their portfolio, and can vary over time. For example, the Education Commissioner has been growing in importance, in line with the rise in the importance of education and culture in European policy-making.[66] Another example is the Competition Commissioner, who holds a highly visible position with global reach.[64] Before the commission can assume office, the college as a whole must be approved by the Parliament.[44] Commissioners are supported by their personal cabinet who give them political guidance, while the Civil Service (the DGs, see below) deal with technical preparation.[67]

[Summary: The President of the Commission is appointed through an indirect election process, starting with the European Council selecting a candidate using a Qualified Majority Vote (QMV). This selection considers the results of the latest parliamentary elections. The chosen candidate then requires approval from the European Parliament; if the Parliament fails to elect the candidate, the European Council must propose a new one within one month.]

AppointmentFloor 13 of the Berlaymont, Commission's meeting roomThe President of the Commission is appointed in an indirect election. The candidate is first selected by the European Council, according to the Qualified Majority Vote (QMV), taking into account the latest parliamentary elections (any person from the largest party can be picked[68]). That candidate then faces approval by the European Parliament. If the European Parliament fails to elect the candidate, the European Council shall propose another within one month.[7][6]


=== SEGMENT 24 ===
[Summary: The process for appointing the College of Commissioners begins after the President and High Representative are selected, with member states proposing candidates (excluding those who provided the President or High Representative) in consultation with the Commission President and the Council of the European Union, which formally adopts the list. The proposed College then faces hearings and a suitability vote by the European Parliament; a negative opinion on an individual candidate requires the President to either reshuffle or request a replacement from the member state. Once approved by Parliament, the college is formally appointed by the European Council via a Qualified Majority Vote (QMV).]

Following the selection of the President, and the appointment of the High Representative by the European Council, each Commissioner is proposed by their member state (except for those states who provided the President and High Representative) in consultation with the Commission President and the Council of the European Union, who formally adopts the list of candidates. The President's proposed College of Commissioners is then subject to hearings at the European Parliament which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole. If the European Parliament submits a negative opinion of a candidate, the President must either reshuffle them or request a new candidate from the member state to avoid the college's outright rejection by the European Parliament. Once the college is approved by parliament, it is formally appointed following a QMV vote by the European Council.[7]

[Summary: Following the appointment of the College of Commissioners, the President appoints Vice-presidents to manage multi-commissioner policy areas, including the High Representative who automatically serves as a Vice-president (HR/VP) coordinating external relations. The von der Leyen Commission also introduced senior Executive Vice-presidents to manage top priority policy areas. The European Parliament holds the power of dismissal, able to dissolve the entire College through a two-thirds vote of no-confidence, while only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner, though the European Court of Justice can compel a Commissioner to retire for breach of obligation.]

Following the college's appointment, the President appoints a number of Vice-presidents from among the commissioners. Vice-presidents manage policy areas involving multiple Commissioners.[69] One of these includes the High Representative, who is automatically one of the Vice-presidents ex officio rather than by appointment and confirmation. Commonly referred to as the 'HR/VP' position, the High Representative also coordinates commissioners' activities involving the external relations and defence cooperation of the European Union. The von der Leyen Commission also created the position of more senior Executive Vice-presidents, appointed from the three largest political groups in the European Parliament. Unlike the other vice-presidents, their mission is to manage the incumbent Commission's top priority policy areas, for which they receive additional support from a dedicated Directorate-General.[70]DismissalThe European Parliament can dissolve the College of Commissioners as a whole following a vote of no-confidence, which requires a two-thirds vote.Only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner. However, individual Commissioners, by request of the council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

[Summary: The Barroso Commission, which took office in late 2004 following parliamentary objections and a reshuffle, grew to 27 members in 2007 with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. Barroso adopted a more presidential, though criticized, style of control over the college due to its increasing size. Despite this style, the Commission began losing influence to larger member states, a trend exacerbated by the creation of the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon, leading to greater internal politicization.]

Political stylesThe Barroso Commission took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style of control over the college, which earned him some criticism.[71]However, under Barroso, the commission began to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased with the creation of the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon.[72] There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission.

[Summary: The administration of the European Commission is structured into departments called Directorates-General (DGs), which manage specific policy areas and internal services, similar to national ministries. Each DG is led by a director-general who reports to a commissioner, and DGs prepare proposals that require approval by a majority of commissioners before being forwarded to the Parliament and Council for consideration. The Commission's civil service is overseen by a Secretary General, and its organization is defined by its rules of procedure.]

AdministrationFurther information: European Civil ServiceCypriot politician Androulla Vassiliou was European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth between 2010 and 2014.The commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. Each covers a specific policy area such as agriculture or justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as human resources and translation and is headed by a director-general who is responsible to a commissioner. A commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs; they prepare proposals for them and if approved by a majority of commissioners proposals go forward to the Parliament and Council for consideration.[44][73] The Commission's civil service is headed by a Secretary General. The position is currently held by Ilze Juhansone.[74] The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the commission's operation and organisation.[46]

[Summary: The highly fragmented structure of the Commission's Directorates-General (DGs) has been criticized for causing internal competition and 'turf wars,' often allowing DGs to exert significant control over Commissioners who lack time to manage their staff effectively. As of September 2012, the Commission employed 23,803 officials and temporary agents, alongside 9,230 external staff. The Directorate-General for Translation is the single largest DG, and Belgian nationals form the largest staff group (18.7%), primarily because the majority of staff are based in Belgium.]

There has been criticism from a number of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in turf wars as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.[75][76]According to figures published by the commission, 23,803 persons were employed by the commission as officials and temporary agents in September 2012. In addition to these, 9230 "external staff" (e.g. Contractual agents, detached national experts, young experts, trainees etc.) were employed. The single largest DG is the Directorate-General for Translation, with a 2309-strong staff, while the largest group by nationality is Belgian (18.7%), probably due to a majority (17,664) of staff being based in the country.[77]

[Summary: The European Commission manages its press communications through the Directorate-General Communication. The Commission's chief spokesperson, Paula Pinho, conducts the daily "Midday Presser" briefings every weekday in the Berlaymont press room. During this unique event, journalists can pose questions to Commission officials and receive on-the-record answers suitable for live television.]

PressPress Room in the BerlaymontCommunication with the press is handled by the Directorate-General Communication. The Commission's chief spokesperson is Paula Pinho who holds the midday press briefings, commonly known as the "Midday Presser". It takes place every weekday in the Commission's press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions to the Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an "on the record" answer for live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world.[78]

[Summary: The Spokesperson's Service, which is part of the Directorate-General for Communication, supports the President and Commissioners in effective communication, with the chief spokesperson reporting directly to the President on political matters. Commission press releases are considered uniquely political, often undergoing multiple drafts to justify the EU and the Commission, which increases their length and complexity. This process also leads to internal competition between departments and an unusually high volume of press releases, unique to the EU's political structure.]

As an integral part of the Directorate-General for Communication, the Spokesperson's Service, in coordination with the Executive Communication Adviser in the President's Cabinet, supports the President and Commissioners so that they can communicate effectively. On political communication matters, the chief spokesperson reports directly to the President of the European Commission.It has been noted by one researcher that the press releases issued by the commission are uniquely political. A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the commission and is used "for justifying the EU and the Commission" increasing their length and complexity. Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioners themselves. This also leads to an unusually high number of press releases, and is seen as a unique product of the EU's political set-up.[76]

[Summary: Brussels hosts a larger press corps than Washington, D.C., with media outlets from every EU member-state having a correspondent there in 2020. Despite worldwide cuts in journalism, the EU's extensive media operations, such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV, influence how news organizations cover the Union.

There is a larger press corps in Brussels than Washington, D.C.; in 2020, media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels correspondent. Although there has been a worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies.[79] The Commission shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013,[80] though the decision was criticised.[81]Legitimacy and criticismSee also: Democratic legitimacy of the European Union § European CommissionAs the commission is the executive branch, candidates are chosen individually by the 27 national governments.

[Summary: The European Commission's legitimacy is based on the European Parliament's approval and power to dismiss the body. However, Eurosceptics frequently question this legitimacy, pointing to the low turnout (often less than 50% since 1999) in European Parliament elections and the lack of direct elections for the Commission President. Additionally, the Commission's ability to directly shape implementing legislation (with comitology oversight) is cited as a source of democratic concern.]

red from the European Parliament, along with its power to dismiss the body. Eurosceptics have therefore raised the concern of the relatively low turnout (often less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, the fact that there are no direct elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some Eurosceptics.[82] The fact that the commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.[83]

[Summary: Despite evolving democratic structures, the creation of a corresponding European civil society has lagged. The Treaty of Lisbon attempts to resolve the perceived democratic deficit by institutionalizing greater controls on the European Commission, including linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. Historically viewed as a technocratic body removed from party politics, defenders of the Commission counter criticisms by pointing out that legislation must be approved by the Council and the European Parliament before it can be adopted.]

Even though democratic structures and methods are changing there is not such a mirror in creating a European civil society.[84] The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the perceived deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. Historically, the commission had indeed been seen as a technocratic expert body which, akin with institutions such as independent central banks, deals with technical areas of policy and therefore ought to be removed from party politics.[85] From this viewpoint, electoral pressures would undermine the commission's role as an independent regulator.[86] Defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in most areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.[86]

[Summary: The European Commission has faced significant criticism regarding transparency and conduct, evidenced by the 2009 European Ombudsman statistics where 66% of citizen complaints were lodged against it, mainly citing lack of transparency. Furthermore, the Commission was sued in 2010 for blocking access to documents related to biofuel policy. Despite these governance criticisms, the Commission also took proactive steps, notably putting forward an Anti-Racism Action Plan in September 2020 to address structural racism and lack of diversity among Brussels decision-makers.]

In 2009 the European ombudsman published statistics of citizens' complaints against EU institutions, with most of them filed against the commission (66%) and concerning lack of transparency (36%).[87] In 2010 the commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy.[88] This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies.[89] Lack of transparency, unclear lobbyist relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the commission was highlighted in a number of reports by internal and independent auditing organisations.[90][91][92][93] It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, particularly with regard to Microsoft.[94] In September 2020, the European Commission put forward an Anti-Racism Action Plan to tackle the structural racism in the European Union, including measures to address the lack of racial diversity among the European decision makers in Brussels, as denounced by the #BrusselsSoWhite movement.[95]

This plan, which aims to protect the over 511 million citizens across the 27 EU member states, proposed for the first time that medical preparedness against CBRN threats should be a high priority.]

InitiativesAnti-terrorismThe European Commission has an Action Plan to enhance preparedness against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) security risks as part of its anti-terrorism package released in October 2017. In recent times Europe has seen an increased threat level[quantify][from whom?] of CBRN attacks.[citation needed][according to whom?] As such, the European Commission's preparedness plan is important, said Steven Neville Chatfield, a director for the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response in the United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency. For the first time, the European Commission proposed that medical preparedness for CBRN attack threats is a high priority. "The European Commission's (EC) Action Plan to enhance preparedness against CBRN security risks is part of its anti-terrorism package released in October 2017, a strategy aimed at better protecting the more than 511 million citizens across the 27 member states of the European Union (EU)."[96]
