### 🚧 v2.6 Svelte 5 Migration Cleanup (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Close out the Svelte 5 migration debt — fix hydration reactivity bugs, migrate the remaining legacy layouts to runes, resolve voter-app rendering gaps surfaced by v2.5 UAT, and drive the E2E carry-forward pool toward green.

- [x] **Phase 60: Layout Runes Migration & Hydration Fix** — Root + candidate-protected layouts run under runes mode; protected layout renders post-hydration on full page loads (completed 2026-04-24)
- [ ] **Phase 61: Voter-App Question Flow** — Boolean question rendering, candidate-result boolean handling, and category-selection reactivity restored
- [ ] **Phase 62: Results Page Consolidation** — `EntityListControls` + `EntityList` merged; results-page filters re-enabled; entity-detail route collapsed into a single route
- [ ] **Phase 63: E2E Template Extension & Greening** — E2E carry-forward pool shrinks from the post-v2.5 baseline; `app_settings` block in e2e template retires the legacy `updateAppSettings` workaround

## Phase Details

### Phase 60: Layout Runes Migration & Hydration Fix
**Goal**: Both the root layout and the candidate protected layout run under Svelte 5 runes mode, render reliably after SSR + hydration on full page loads, and no longer depend on undocumented workarounds for store-driven rendering.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v2.6)
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The root layout (`apps/frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte`) contains no `export let`, no `$:` reactive statements, and no `<slot />` — it uses `$props`, `$derived`, and `{@render children()}` consistently.
  2. A fresh candidate arriving at a protected candidate route via full page load (not client-side navigation) sees the candidate dashboard render after data resolution — the page no longer stays stuck at `<Loading />`.
  3. The `PopupRenderer` workaround is either removed (direct store rendering now works through the migrated root layout) or retained with a documented in-code rationale that names the upstream Svelte 5 limitation it still guards against.
  4. Existing voter-app and candidate-app E2E tests that previously passed continue to pass — the layout migration introduces no regressions to the Playwright parity baseline.
**Plans**: 5 plans
  - [x] 60-01-PLAN.md — Wave-0 prep: restore diff-playwright-reports.ts + baseline JSON; create D-09 setTimeout-popup E2E scaffold
  - [x] 60-02-PLAN.md — Root `+layout.svelte` $derived refactor (LAYOUT-01, D-05)
  - [x] 60-03-PLAN.md — Protected `(protected)/+layout.svelte` $derived refactor + D-02 wrapper fallback gate (LAYOUT-02)
  - [x] 60-04-PLAN.md — D-08 PopupRenderer empirical removal + D-10 retention branch (LAYOUT-03)
  - [x] 60-05-PLAN.md — Playwright parity gate vs baseline `3c57949c8` (SC-4) — PARITY GATE: FAIL documented (24 regressions all Category A orthogonal, handoff to Phase 61); LAYOUT-01/02/03 satisfied by alternative evidence; `pending_review: true`
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 61: Voter-App Question Flow
**Goal**: The voter question flow — from category selection, through boolean questions, to candidate match detail — renders and reacts correctly across all question types produced by the default seed template. Also restores candidate-app question-list reactivity so the `candidate-questions.spec.ts` cascade surfaced by Phase 60 clears.
**Depends on**: Phase 60 (runes-mode root layout lets downstream reactivity rely on Svelte 5 idioms end-to-end)
**Requirements**: QUESTION-01, QUESTION-02, QUESTION-03, QUESTION-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A voter encountering a boolean-type question sees an appropriate binary answer control (yes/no or equivalent), can submit an answer, and advances to the next question.
  2. Opening a candidate result-detail page after answering a boolean question renders the per-question match breakdown without error — the question-type switch handles `boolean` alongside `singleChoiceOrdinal` and `singleChoiceCategorical`.
  3. On the category-selection screen, the voter sees a sensible default selection (all opinion categories checked by default, or an explicit product decision documented at the component) and the "questions" counter updates reactively on every category toggle — no stuck-at-0 behaviour.
  4. On the candidate app question route, the `candidate-questions-list` and `candidate-questions-start` testIds become visible within Playwright's default timeout, the 6 direct `candidate-questions.spec.ts` tests pass, and their 18 dependent cascade tests (candidate-app-mutation / candidate-app-settings / candidate-app-password / re-auth-setup) run and pass. (Folded from Phase 60 handoff 2026-04-24.)
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [x] 61-01-PLAN.md — Boolean opinion input + auto-fix result-detail boolean match-breakdown via shared OpinionQuestionInput dispatch (QUESTION-01 + QUESTION-02)
  - [x] 61-02-PLAN.md — Category default + counter reactivity: migrate voterContext selectedQuestionCategoryIds to pure $state per D-11 (QUESTION-03)
  - [x] 61-03-PLAN.md — Candidate-questions testId visibility: diagnose-first then apply reactivity/readiness/timeout fix (QUESTION-04)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 62: Results Page Consolidation
**Goal**: The voter results page renders through a single merged entity-list component, filters work without triggering an infinite `$effect` loop, the results list and entity-detail drawer share a 4-segment optional-param route that handles the org-list + candidate-drawer edge case cleanly, and filter state is exposed via a shared `filterContext` so a future LLM chat can read and mutate the voter's active filters.
**Depends on**: Phase 60 (layout-based rendering path relied on in the consolidated results layout)
**Requirements**: RESULTS-01, RESULTS-02, RESULTS-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A voter reaching `/results` sees the merged entity list + controls render once — no infinite-loop symptoms (frozen UI, runaway re-renders) when filters are toggled.
  2. Filters on the voter results page are enabled and functional — toggling a filter narrows the displayed candidate/organization list without regressing the layout-based render path. Filter state lives in a shared `filterContext` module (bundled through `voterContext` for ergonomic consumption), scoped per (election, plural) tuple, preserved across drawer open/close.
  3. The empty `results/+page.svelte` no longer exists; the results list and the entity-detail drawer share the path `/results/[electionId]/[[entityTypePlural]]/[[entityTypeSingular]]/[[id]]` with typed param matchers (`entityTypePlural` ∈ {candidates, organisations}; `entityTypeSingular` ∈ {candidate, organisation}). The schema supports the org-list + candidate-drawer edge case. `entityTypePlural` drives the Tabs component via `$page.params`. On full-page-load to a detail URL, drawer rendering is prioritized over list rendering for perceived performance.
  4. The filter-driven list derivation uses `$derived` — there is no `$effect` + `filterGroup.onChange` → `updateFilters` → `filterGroup.apply` circular chain in the merged `EntityListWithControls` component. `@openvaa/filters` is untouched (consumer-side refactor only).
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [x] 62-01-PLAN.md — filterContext (version-counter bridge over FilterGroup.onChange) + EntityListWithControls compound (RESULTS-01, RESULTS-02)
  - [x] 62-02-PLAN.md — Route collapse to 4-segment optional shape + entityTypePlural/entityTypeSingular param matchers (RESULTS-03)
  - [x] 62-03-PLAN.md — results/+layout.svelte URL-driven tabs + drawer + filter re-enable + drawer-first paint + E2E coverage (RESULTS-01, RESULTS-02, RESULTS-03)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 63: E2E Template Extension & Greening
**Goal**: The Playwright carry-forward pool shrinks measurably from the post-v2.5 baseline, and the `@openvaa/dev-seed` e2e template carries its own `app_settings` block so the legacy `updateAppSettings(...)` workaround can be retired.
**Depends on**: Phase 60 (LAYOUT-02 fix is the largest single source of reclaimed tests — 2 direct blocks + ~35 cascade)
**Requirements**: E2E-01, E2E-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Relative to the post-v2.5 parity baseline on SHA `3c57949c8` (10 data-race + 38 cascade failures out of 89 total), the Playwright carry-forward failure pool is measurably smaller — at minimum the 2 direct candidate-registration tests (`candidate-registration.spec.ts:64`, `candidate-profile.spec.ts:51`) pass, and their ~35 downstream cascade tests run and pass independently.
  2. Any residual failures that remain after Phase 60-62 land are documented as framework-level (upstream Svelte 5 bug or structural test-concurrency issue) with a specific pointer — not generic "flake" — and do not block milestone close.
  3. The `e2e` template in `@openvaa/dev-seed` carries an `app_settings.fixed[]` block whose emitted defaults match the values currently applied by the 4 legacy `updateAppSettings(...)` call sites (`data.setup.ts` + 3 variant setups, ~60 lines per Plan 59-04 Rule-2 follow-up).
  4. After the template change lands, the 4 legacy `updateAppSettings(...)` blocks are deleted and the Playwright parity gate prints `PARITY GATE: PASS` against the post-v2.5 baseline.
