<summary>✅ v2.11 Svelte 5 Runes Migration + View Transitions (Phases 95-101) — SHIPPED 2026-06-07</summary>

**Goal:** Retire every remaining legacy `svelte/store` bridge in the frontend for idiomatic Svelte 5 runes (Domain A — 4 waves: contexts → bridges → consumer codemod → cleanup), ship the View Transitions cross-fade + WCAG 2.1 AA navigation-a11y that closes the perceived "redraw on Q→Q" (Domain B — 2 waves), then re-enable the 2 quarantined `perm-per-app-notifications` E2E tests and prove the full suite stays green vs the v2.10 baseline. Final gate: **84 passed / 0 skipped** + full unit green + a11y-smoke 10/10 + 3× determinism.

- [x] Phase 95: Domain A Wave 1 — Tier-1 Leaf Contexts (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-06-04

<summary>⊘ v2.12 Runes-Native Cleanup (Phases 102-105) — SUPERSEDED 2026-06-12 by v2.13</summary>

**Superseded mid-flight by v2.13 Context-as-Class Migration.** Phase 102 (Handle-Idiom Spike) locked a
get/set-accessor + plain-getter idiom for the 40 `{ readonly current }` handles; Phase 103 began the
`.current` codemod (1/2 plans). The follow-on spike line (017–023) + `CONTEXT-MEMBER-AUDIT.md` then proved
the deeper move — **context-as-class** — and LOCKED it 2026-06-12. The class field subsumes the handle
idiom, so Phase 103 was abandoned and the migration restarted as v2.13; the Store→State rename (104) +
straggler clearance + green gate (105) carried forward.

- [x] Phase 102: Handle-Idiom Spike (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-06-09 _(decision superseded)_
- [~] Phase 103: `.current` Handle Codemod (1/2 plans) — abandoned _(codemod authored, never applied)_
- [ ] Phase 104: Store → State Rename — not started → **v2.13**
- [ ] Phase 105: Straggler Clearance + Green Gate — not started → **v2.13**
