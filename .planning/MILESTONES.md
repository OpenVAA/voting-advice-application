# Milestones

## v1.3 Svelte 5 Migration (Content) (Shipped: 2026-03-20)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases, 19 plans
**Timeline:** 3 days (2026-03-18 → 2026-03-20)
**Branch:** feat-gsd-roadmap (99 commits, 334 files, +18.2k/-4.3k lines)
**Requirements:** 20/20 satisfied

**Key accomplishments:**

- 98 shared and voter-app leaf components migrated to Svelte 5 runes mode ($props, $derived, $effect, $bindable)
- All container components converted from named slots to snippet props with 39+ route consumer updates
- All voter route pages and layouts migrated from $: reactive statements to $derived/$effect runes
- All TODO[Svelte 5] markers resolved in v1.3 scope; candidate app call sites updated for API changes
- Zero legacy Svelte 4 patterns remaining in voter app routes and shared components
- All 26 voter-app E2E tests passing after full migration with zero TypeScript errors

### Known Gaps

- **Nyquist validation:** Partial across phases 23-26 (phase 24 missing VALIDATION.md)
- **Snippet reactivity bug:** $state mutations in event handlers don't trigger re-render in {#snippet} blocks (likely Svelte 5 core issue)
- **E2E test count:** Requirement stated "92 tests" but voter-app scope is 26 tests (all passing)
- **2 pre-existing test failures:** auth-setup (Strapi timeout), voter-settings category intros (data configuration)

## v1.2 Svelte 5 Migration (Infrastructure) (Shipped: 2026-03-18)

**Phases completed:** 7 phases, 14 plans
**Timeline:** 3 days (2026-03-15 → 2026-03-18)
**Branch:** feat-gsd-roadmap (96 commits, 861 files, +29.5k/-6.3k lines)
**Requirements:** 31/31 satisfied

**Key accomplishments:**

- Fresh SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 scaffold with native TypeScript, @tailwindcss/vite replacing PostCSS
- Tailwind 4 CSS-first configuration with DaisyUI 5 and full theme token migration from JS to CSS
- Migrated i18n from sveltekit-i18n to Paraglide JS — 740 call sites, compile-time type safety, runtime override wrapper
- Full monorepo dependency bump with Yarn catalog expansion (13 → 30 entries)
- Node 22 migration with Docker, CI, and 92 E2E tests validated end-to-end
- OXC toolchain evaluated and deferred (Svelte template linting not supported)
- Migration cleanup: dead code removal and TypeScript error fixes

### Known Gaps

- **Nyquist validation:** Incomplete across phases (draft/missing VALIDATION.md files)
- **Human testing debt:** Language switching and runtime overrides need live Docker stack testing
- **Svelte 5 runes:** 13 TODO[Svelte 5] markers deferred to content migration milestone

**Phases completed:** 6 phases, 15 plans
**Timeline:** 4 days (2026-03-12 → 2026-03-15)
**Branch:** feat-gsd-roadmap (87 commits, 1,717 files, +14.7k/-3.2k lines)
**Requirements:** 23/24 satisfied (VER-04 deferred by user)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Turborepo integration with cached parallel builds and dependency-aware task orchestration
- Monorepo restructured to apps/ + packages/ convention with full Docker/CI/E2E updates
- Changesets for automated versioning, changelogs, and release PRs
- npm publishing readiness — tsup builds, metadata, fresh install verified for 4 packages (@openvaa/core, data, matching, filters)
- Yarn 4.13 with dependency catalogs and Vercel remote caching in CI
- Tech debt cleanup — 9 audit items resolved across pre-commit hooks, version strings, docs

### Known Gaps

- **VER-04**: Changeset bot for PRs — deferred by user (can be installed later via GitHub App)
